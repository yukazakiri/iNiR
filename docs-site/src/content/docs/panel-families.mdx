# Panel Families

iNiR has two panel families: **ii** and **waffle**. Each one is a complete shell layout with its own panels, settings window, and design language. Switch between them at runtime with `Mod+Shift+W`.

## ii

The default. Floating panels, Material Design language.

### Layout

| Element | Position | Contents |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Bar** | Top (configurable) | Workspaces, tray, media, weather, clock, utility buttons |
| **Left sidebar** | Left edge | AI chat, app launcher, search |
| **Right sidebar** | Right edge | Quick toggles, notepad, calendar |
| **Dock** | Bottom (floating) | Pinned apps, running indicators |

### Features

- **Bar positioning** — top, bottom, left, or right; optional vertical mode
- **Dual sidebars** — left for apps/AI, right for toggles/tools
- **Floating dock** — auto-hide, drag to reorder, running indicators
- **Niri overview** — adapted for scrolling workspaces with app icons
- **Five visual styles** — Material, Cards, Aurora, iNiR, Angel

## waffle

Bottom taskbar layout inspired by Windows 11. Its own settings window, its own panels.

### Layout

| Element | Position | Contents |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Taskbar** | Bottom | Start button, pinned apps, tray, clock, action center |

### Features

- **Centered taskbar** — pinned apps with running indicators, system tray
- **Start menu** — app grid with search, recent apps, power options
- **Action center** — WiFi, Bluetooth, volume, brightness toggles
- **Notification center** — popup notifications with history
- **Widgets panel** — weather, calendar, system stats
- **Task view** — workspace overview with window previews
- **Own theming** — separate color system with live previews

## Comparison

| | ii | waffle |
|---|---|---|
| Layout | Floating panels + sidebars | Bottom taskbar |
| Bar position | Top / bottom / left / right | Bottom only |
| Sidebars | Left + right | No |
| Dock | Separate floating dock | Integrated in taskbar |
| Settings | Material Design settings | Win11-style settings |
| Visual styles | Material, Cards, Aurora, iNiR, Angel | Own styling |

## Switching

**Keybind:** `Mod+Shift+W` cycles between families.

**IPC:**

```bash
qs -c ii ipc call panelFamily set ii
qs -c ii ipc call panelFamily set waffle
qs -c ii ipc call panelFamily cycle
```

**Config:**

```json
"panelFamily": "waffle"
```

When you switch, all panels from the old family unload and the new family's panels load. You can't mix panels from both families.

## Shared between both

These work regardless of which family is active:

- Clipboard history
- Region tools (screenshot, OCR, recording, image search)
- Media controls
- Lock screen
- Session menu (power options)
- Notifications
- Wallpaper theming

## Troubleshooting

**Family won't switch** — check `qs log -c ii | grep family`, try forcing via IPC, restart if needed.

**Panels missing** — verify `enabledPanels` in config includes the right identifiers for your active family.
