# iNiR

A full desktop shell for Niri, built on Quickshell and QML. Originally forked from end-4's illogical-impulse, now its own thing.

## What is this?

All the UI you need on top of a Niri session. Bar, dock, sidebars, overview, clipboard, media controls, lock screen, notifications, and a settings GUI for everything. One process, one config.

Two panel families you can switch between at runtime. Five visual styles. Colors pulled from your wallpaper or from 41 built-in presets.

## Panel families

- **ii** — floating panels, Material Design language, sidebars, configurable bar positioning
- **waffle** — bottom taskbar with start menu and action center, inspired by Win11

Switch with `Mod+Shift+W` or via IPC. No restart.

## Visual styles

- **Material** — solid opaque backgrounds
- **Cards** — card-based layout with subtle shadows
- **Aurora** — glass blur, translucent panels (GPU-intensive)
- **iNiR** — thin TUI-style borders, minimal
- **Angel** — neo-brutalism with frosted glass and escalonado shadows

## What ships with it

**UI panels:** bar, dock, overview, overlay, sidebars (left/right), notifications

**Tools:** clipboard history, screenshot/OCR/recording, media controls (MPRIS + YtMusic), wallpaper selector, lock screen

**Theming:** wallpaper color extraction via matugen, 41 presets, terminal theme sync for foot/kitty/alacritty/wezterm/ghostty/konsole

**Performance:** GameMode auto-detection, low power mode, per-module disable

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snowarch/inir.git ~/.config/quickshell/ii
cd ~/.config/quickshell/ii
./setup install
qs -c ii
```

## Requirements

- Arch Linux (or derivative)
- Niri compositor (Hyprland has partial support)
- Quickshell (official repos), Qt 6.6+
- PipeWire, matugen
- 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended

## FAQ

**Hyprland?** — Partial. Most things work but overview and some Niri-specific features don't. For Hyprland, use illogical-impulse directly.

**Ubuntu/Fedora?** — You'll need to build Quickshell from source. Only Arch is officially supported.

**RAM usage?** — 200-400MB depending on what's enabled. Disable video wallpapers and AI chat if memory is tight.

**Customizable?** — Every option has a GUI control. Config is JSON at `~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json`. You can also edit QML directly.

## When something breaks

```bash
qs log -c ii | tail -50     # check logs
qs kill -c ii; qs -c ii     # restart
./setup doctor              # validate setup
```
