# iNiR vs illogical-impulse

Short version: **Niri? Use iNiR. Hyprland? Use illogical-impulse.**

## Background

illogical-impulse by end-4 is the original project, built for Hyprland. iNiR is a fork by snowarch, adapted for Niri with its own features on top. They share the same Quickshell + QML foundation but target different compositors.

## Differences

| | iNiR | illogical-impulse |
|---|---|---|
| Compositor | Niri | Hyprland |
| Workspace model | Scrolling | Grid |
| Panel families | ii + waffle | ii only |
| Config path | `~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json` | `~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json` |
| Maintainer | snowarch | end-4 |

## What iNiR adds

- **waffle panel family** — taskbar, start menu, action center, widgets panel, task view
- **Niri-native overview** — built for scrolling workspaces, not grid
- **Per-monitor wallpapers** — different wallpaper per screen, per-monitor color extraction
- **Shell update overlay** — see what changed before updating
- **Weather geocoding** — city name or GPS for manual location

## Compositor support

**iNiR on Niri:** primary target. Most features are designed and tested for Niri.

**iNiR on Hyprland:** partial. Some features are Hyprland-only, and some behaviors differ between compositors.

**illogical-impulse on Niri:** not supported. Different workspace model, different IPC layer.

For a detailed breakdown of what is compositor-specific, see [Limitations](/docs/limitations).

## Configs are not compatible

Similar JSON structure but different keys and different defaults. If migrating:

```bash
# backup old config
cp ~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json ~/illogical-impulse-config-backup.json

# install iNiR
git clone https://github.com/snowarch/inir.git ~/.config/quickshell/ii
cd ~/.config/quickshell/ii && ./setup install
```

Port settings manually. Don't copy the whole config file — schema differences will break things.
