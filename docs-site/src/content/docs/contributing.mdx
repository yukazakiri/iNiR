# Contributing

iNiR is open source and welcomes contributions. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

## Getting Started

### Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inir.git
cd inir
```

### Development Setup

```bash
./setup install
```

This installs iNiR in development mode. Changes to QML files hot-reload automatically.

### Running from Source

```bash
qs -c ii
```

Check logs:

```bash
qs log -c ii -f
```

## Project Structure

```

## Code Style

### QML

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Follow existing patterns
- Use design tokens (never hardcode colors/sizes)
- Support all five global styles (Material, Cards, Aurora, iNiR, Angel)
- Add null-safety (`?.` and `??`)

Example:

```qml
Rectangle {
    color: Appearance.colors.colLayer1
    radius: Appearance.rounding.normal

    property string value: Config.options?.module?.option ?? "default"
}
```

### JavaScript

- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Handle errors gracefully

### Shell Scripts

- Use Fish shell syntax
- Add comments for complex logic
- Check for dependencies before using them

## Making Changes

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Edit QML files
- Test thoroughly
- Check logs for errors
- Verify on different screen sizes

### 3. Test

```bash
# Restart iNiR
qs kill -c ii && qs -c ii

# Check logs
qs log -c ii | grep -i error

# Test the feature
# Open settings, test UI, check all five styles
```

### 4. Commit

Use conventional commits:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(bar): add new widget"
git commit -m "fix(dock): resolve icon sizing issue"
git commit -m "docs: update installation guide"
```

Types:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `style` - Code style (formatting)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `perf` - Performance improvement
- `test` - Tests
- `chore` - Maintenance

### 5. Push and PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Create a pull request on GitHub with:
- Clear description of changes
- Screenshots/videos if UI changes
- Testing steps
- Related issues

## Guidelines

### Adding Features

- Check if it fits iNiR's scope
- Discuss in an issue first for large features
- Make it configurable (add to settings)
- Support both panel families if applicable
- Update documentation

### Fixing Bugs

- Reproduce the bug first
- Check if it's already reported
- Fix the root cause, not the symptom
- Add comments explaining the fix
- Test edge cases

### Documentation

- Write in clear, natural language
- No corporate speak or AI-sounding text
- Include code examples
- Update relevant docs when changing features

### Design

- Follow Material Design principles (ii family)
- Follow Windows 11 design (waffle family)
- Use existing design tokens
- Support all five global styles
- Test on different screen sizes

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Restart iNiR
2. Check logs for errors
3. Test the feature
4. Test on different screen sizes
5. Test with different themes
6. Test with different panel families

### Automated Testing

Currently no automated tests. Manual testing required.

## Code Review

Pull requests are reviewed for:

- Code quality
- Design consistency
- Performance impact
- Breaking changes
- Documentation updates

Be patient. Reviews may take a few days.
