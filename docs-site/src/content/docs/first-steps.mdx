# First Steps

You've installed iNiR. Now what?

## Verify Everything Works

Check the logs to make sure iNiR started correctly:

```bash
qs log -c ii
```

You should see "Config ready" and no critical errors. Some warnings about missing optional features are normal.

## Learn the Basics

### Opening Things

- `Mod+Space` - Overview (see all workspaces and windows)
- `Super+G` - Overlay (search apps, files, widgets)
- `Alt+Tab` - Switch between windows
- `Super+V` - Clipboard history
- `Super+,` - Settings

### Taking Screenshots

- `Super+Shift+S` - Select a region to screenshot
- `Print` - Full screenshot
- `Super+Shift+X` - OCR (extract text from screen)

### Managing Windows

- `Super+Q` - Close window
- `Super+F` - Fullscreen
- `Super+Left/Right` - Move focus between windows
- `Super+1-9` - Switch to workspace 1-9

## Configure Your Setup

Open settings with `Super+,` or run:

```bash
qs -c ii ipc call settings open
```

### Essential Settings

**Appearance**
- Choose your global style: Material, Cards, Aurora (glass), iNiR (minimal), or Angel (neo-brutalism)
- Enable/disable transparency
- Pick a theme preset or let matugen generate colors from your wallpaper

**Panel Family**
- ii (Material Design) - Floating bar, sidebars
- waffle (Windows 11) - Bottom taskbar, action center

**Modules**
- Enable/disable specific features
- Reduce memory usage by disabling what you don't use

**Performance**
- Low power mode for laptops
- Reduce animations for older hardware
- GameMode auto-detection for fullscreen apps

## Set Your Wallpaper

iNiR uses matugen to generate colors from your wallpaper.

### Using the Wallpaper Selector

Press `Ctrl+Alt+T` to open the wallpaper selector, or:

```bash
qs -c ii ipc call wallpaperSelector toggle
```

### Manual Wallpaper

Edit your config:

```bash
nano ~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json
```

Find the `background` section and set your wallpaper path:

```json
"background": {
  "wallpaperPath": "/path/to/your/wallpaper.jpg"
}
```

Then restart iNiR:

```bash
qs kill -c ii && qs -c ii
```

## Customize Keybinds

Edit Niri's config:

```bash
nano ~/.config/niri/config.kdl
```

Add your custom keybinds in the `binds` section. See the IPC documentation for all available commands.

Example:

```kdl
binds {
    Super+P { spawn "qs" "-c" "ii" "ipc" "call" "session" "toggle"; }
}
```

Reload Niri config:

```bash
niri msg action load-config-file
```

## Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:

1. Check the logs: `qs log -c ii`
2. Restart iNiR: `qs kill -c ii && qs -c ii`
3. Check for missing dependencies
