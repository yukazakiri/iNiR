# Installation

iNiR is designed for Arch Linux. The installer only supports Arch-based distros. If you're on something else, check the manual section below.

## Quick Install (Arch)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snowarch/inir.git
cd inir
./setup install
```

Add `-y` if you don't want to answer questions:

```bash
./setup install -y
```

When it's done:

```bash
niri msg action load-config-file
```

Log out and back in, or restart Niri.

## Manual Installation

For when you're not on Arch, or you want more control.

### 1. Get dependencies

The bare minimum to not crash immediately:

| Package | Why |
|---------|-----|
| `niri` | The compositor |
| `quickshell` | The shell runtime (official repos) |
| `syntax-highlighting` | QML module for code blocks |
| `kirigami` | KDE QML components |
| `kdialog` | KDE runtime helper |
| `plasma-integration` | KDE platform theme plugin |
| `darkly-bin` (AUR) | Darkly Qt style |
| `wl-clipboard` | Copy/paste |
| `cliphist` | Clipboard history |
| `pipewire` + `wireplumber` | Audio |
| `grim` + `slurp` | Screenshots |
| `matugen` | Material You colors from wallpaper |

For everything else, check the packages documentation.

### 2. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snowarch/inir.git ~/.config/quickshell/ii
```

### 3. Copy the configs

```bash
cp -r dots/.config/* ~/.config/
```

This gives you Niri config with ii keybindings, matugen templates, GTK settings, and fuzzel config.

### 4. Tell Niri to start ii

Add this to `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`:

```kdl
spawn-at-startup "qs" "-c" "ii"
```

### 5. Restart Niri

```bash
niri msg action load-config-file
```

Or log out and back in.

## Verify Installation

Check the logs:

```bash
qs log -c ii
```

If everything went well, you should see:
- Bar at the top
- Background/wallpaper
- `Mod+Tab` opens the Niri overview
- `Mod+Space` toggles the ii overview
- `Alt+Tab` cycles windows
- `Super+V` opens clipboard
- `Super+Shift+S` takes a region screenshot

If something's broken, the logs will tell you which package is missing.
