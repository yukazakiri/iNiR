# Limitations

iNiR has some limitations due to compositor constraints, missing features in dependencies, or design decisions.

## Compositor Limitations

### Niri-Specific

**No native window minimization**
- Niri doesn't support minimizing windows
- iNiR works around this by moving windows to a hidden workspace
- Not perfect, but functional

**Click-outside-to-close requires workarounds**
- Niri doesn't have native support for this
- iNiR uses backdrop panels or Escape key
- Some panels auto-close when others open

**No live window previews**
- Niri doesn't expose window thumbnails
- iNiR uses app icons instead
- Overview shows window titles and workspace info

### Hyprland-Specific

**Partial support only**
- Some features work, some don't
- Screen zoom requires Hyprland
- Lock screen blur hack is Hyprland-specific
- Not all IPC commands are tested on Hyprland

## Hardware Limitations

### Audio

**PipeWire required**
- PulseAudio-only systems won't work
- No plans to support PulseAudio
- Migrate to PipeWire if you haven't already

### Display

**External monitor brightness requires DDC/CI**
- Not all monitors support DDC/CI
- Requires `ddcutil` package
- 300ms debounce to prevent flickering
- Laptop internal displays work fine

### Location

**GPS weather requires geoclue**
- Falls back to IP geolocation if geoclue not available
- IP geolocation is less accurate
- Some distros don't ship geoclue by default

## Feature Limitations

### Clipboard

**Requires cliphist**
- No built-in clipboard history
- Must run `wl-paste --watch cliphist store` in background
- Images stored as files, not in memory

### Screenshots

**No built-in screenshot tool**
- Requires `grim` and `slurp`
- Region selection is compositor-dependent
- Some Wayland apps block screenshots (security feature)

### Recording

**Requires wf-recorder**
- No built-in screen recording
- Audio recording requires PipeWire
- Some apps block recording (DRM content)

### OCR

**Requires tesseract**
- No built-in OCR
- Accuracy depends on tesseract language data
- Works best with clear, high-contrast text

### AI Features

**Requires API keys**
- AI chat needs Gemini, Mistral, or OpenRouter API key — or use Ollama for local models
- Voice search needs Gemini API key
- Keys stored in gnome-keyring

## Performance Limitations

### Memory Usage

**200-400MB RAM for full shell**
- QML/Qt runtime is heavy
- Disable unused modules to reduce usage
- Low power mode helps on older hardware

### Animations

**Can be laggy on older hardware**
- Blur effects are expensive
- Reduce animations in settings
- GameMode auto-disables effects
- Switch from Aurora to Material/iNiR style

### Startup Time

**2-3 seconds to fully load**
- QML compilation takes time
- Singletons load on startup
- Lazy loading helps but isn't instant

## Design Limitations

### Configuration

**JSON config file**
- Not the most user-friendly format
- GUI settings help but don't cover everything
- Some advanced options require manual editing

### Theming

**Matugen required for wallpaper colors**
- No built-in color extraction
- Matugen must be installed separately
- Manual theme editing is possible but tedious

### Translations

**Incomplete translations**
- English is primary language
- Some strings not translated
- Contributions welcome

## Workarounds

### Missing Features

If a feature you need isn't available:

1. Check if it's compositor-limited
2. Look for alternative approaches
3. Request it as a feature (GitHub issues)
4. Contribute a PR if you can implement it

### Performance Issues

If iNiR is slow:

1. Disable unused modules
2. Enable low power mode
3. Reduce animations
4. Switch to Material or iNiR style (no blur)
5. Use GameMode for fullscreen apps

### Compatibility Issues

If something doesn't work:

1. Check compositor (Niri vs Hyprland)
2. Verify dependencies are installed
3. Check logs for errors
4. Report issue with system info

## Future Improvements

Some limitations may be addressed in future versions:

- Better Hyprland support
- More efficient rendering
- Reduced memory usage
- Faster startup time
- More complete translations

No promises, but we're working on it.
