# Changelog

All notable changes to iNiR will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.14.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Per-monitor workspaces (Niri)**: Each bar can show workspaces for its own monitor (`bar.workspaces.perMonitor`).
- **Waffle quick actions switches**: Individual toggles for Files/Terminal/Settings/Wallpaper/Screenshot/Screen Record/Session in the Widgets panel.

### Changed
- **Dark mode toggles**: Routed through `MaterialThemeLoader` to ensure a reliable `colors.json` reload after switching.
- **Style selection**: No longer forces `appearance.transparency.enable` when selecting styles.

### Fixed
- **Cloudflare WARP toggle**: Periodic status polling to stay in sync.
- **EasyEffects sink control**: Volume/mute resolves to the physical sink when EasyEffects is the default sink.
- **Wallpaper transitions**: New wallpaper changes fast-forward an in-progress transition; background widget placement is debounced.
- **VS Code Material Code theming**: Respects `appearance.wallpaperTheming.enableVSCode`.
- **Waffle user avatar**: More reliable fallback loading.
- **Waffle settings UI**: Improved loading indicator and multiple polish fixes.

## [2.13.2] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Keyboard-Pro Action Mode**: Comprehensive keyboard-driven command palette accessible via `/` prefix in the overview launcher. Navigate the entire shell without a mouse.
- **Category tab bar**: SecondaryTabBar with animated indicator for All, System, Appearance, Tools, Media, and Settings categories.
- **Arrow key navigation**: Left/Right arrows and Tab/Shift+Tab cycle categories; Up/Down navigate action list; Enter executes.
- **Media playback actions**: Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous Track via MprisController integration.
- **Volume controls**: Volume Up and Volume Down actions via Audio service.
- **Screen recording toggle**: Start/stop wf-recorder from the action palette.
- **Clipboard history action**: Open clipboard manager directly from action mode.
- **Music recognition action**: Trigger SongRec music identification from the palette.
- **Notepad action**: Quick-open the sidebar notepad.
- **EasyEffects toggle**: Enable/disable audio equalizer from action mode.
- **Wallpaper Coverflow action**: Open the coverflow wallpaper selector alongside the existing grid selector.
- **Zoom controls**: Zoom In, Zoom Out, and Reset Zoom actions for accessibility.
- **On-Screen Keyboard toggle**: Show/hide OSK from action mode.
- **Panel family switching**: Switch between ii and waffle panel families from the palette.
- **Paru package manager support**: All package actions (install, remove, update) detect and use paru as AUR helper alongside yay.
- **Todo feedback**: Adding a todo now shows a desktop notification confirming the task was added, with usage hint when no text provided.

- **Keyboard navigation hints footer**: Shows keybind hints (↑↓ Navigate, ↵ Run, Tab/←→ Category, Esc Close) at the bottom of the action panel for discoverability.

### Changed
- **Wallpaper selector split**: "Change Wallpaper" action now explicitly labeled as Grid or Coverflow, each closing the other before opening.
- **AUR badge theming**: Replaced hardcoded `#1793d1` color with `Appearance.colors.colPrimary` / `Appearance.inir.colPrimary` tokens for proper style-aware rendering.
- **System update action**: Now auto-detects yay/paru/pacman instead of using a hardcoded command.
- **Package install action**: Uses runtime AUR helper detection (`yay > paru > sudo pacman`) instead of hardcoded `yay`.
- **Tab bar spacing**: Added horizontal margins (12px) and increased indicator padding (12px) for proper visual separation between category tabs.
- **Package action refactor**: Deduplicated package install/remove logic into `_executePackageActionStatic` with value capture before component destruction.

### Fixed
- **iNiR style icon**: Replaced invalid "spark" Material Symbol with "terminal" for the Style: iNiR action.
- **Left/Right arrows in search input**: Removed Left/Right arrow key interception from SearchBar to prevent conflict with text cursor movement. Category cycling from search now uses Tab/Shift+Tab only; Left/Right remain available from the action list delegates where there is no text cursor conflict.
- **Up arrow on first item**: Pressing Up on the first action list item now returns focus to the search input via `returnToSearch` signal.
- **Escape key**: Pressing Escape from within the action list now closes the overview.
- **ReferenceError on action execute**: Refactored `onClicked` to capture action/package references before closing the overview, preventing use-after-destroy crashes.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Backdrop wallpaper transitions**: Both ii and waffle backdrops now use `WallpaperCrossfader` for smooth wallpaper transition animations matching their workspace counterparts.
- **Animated blur toggle**: New `enableAnimatedBlur` config key for GIF/video wallpapers in both families.
- **Blur transition suppression**: Blur fades out before wallpaper transitions so the change is visible even with windows open, then fades back in after transition completes.
- **Waffle backdrop effects controls**: Vignette, saturation, contrast, and animated blur controls added to waffle backdrop settings.
- **Waffle transition config**: Independent transition settings for waffle wallpapers (`waffles.background.transition`).
- **Spicetify wallpaper theming**: Opt-in Material You color scheme for Spotify via Spicetify with live watch mode — colors update on wallpaper change without restarting Spotify (PR #80 by @yukazakiri).
- **Migration 013**: Auto-patch kde-material-you-colors wrapper on update.
- **Migration 014**: Malloc arena optimization (`MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2`, `MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_=131072`) for reduced glibc memory overhead.
- **Migration 015**: Clean orphan config keys (`blurStatic`, `videoBlurStrength` → `thumbnailBlurStrength`) from existing user configs.

### Changed
- **Blur decoupled from awww renderer**: Blur now reads from the crossfader texture regardless of who renders the visible wallpaper, fixing blur not working when parallax is disabled.
- **blurStatic removed**: Blur only activates when windows are present on the workspace. The always-on `blurStatic` option caused rendering issues in both families and has been removed.
- **videoBlurStrength → thumbnailBlurStrength**: Renamed for clarity; migration preserves user values.
- **Saturation/contrast defaults**: Changed from 1.0 to 0 (neutral) for new installs. Existing users keep their values.
- **Backend provider hardcoded**: `awww` backend is now always active (config key ignored, no UI change).
- **Settings surfaces refreshed**: Updated quick options, control panel, and shell surfaces.

### Fixed
- **Wallpaper double-apply**: Prevent duplicate `switchwall.sh` runs with `_applyInProgress` suppression flag and 3-second timer.
- **kde-material-you-colors stacking**: Kill previous daemon instance before launching new one to prevent orphan processes.
- **StyledListView animations**: Use `Transition.enabled` instead of `running` on child animations to prevent animation glitches.
- **Blur alignment**: Reverted `sourceSize÷4` to screen resolution for correct blur positioning.
- **Blur source loading**: Keep wallpaper source always loaded to avoid style-switch freeze.
- **Todo.qml runtime error**: Replaced invalid `Process.exec` with `Quickshell.execDetached`.
- **Config schema sync**: Added `enableOpenCode`, `vscodeEditors` (14 editor forks), and `omp` (oh-my-posh) to schema and defaults — keys existed in theming scripts but were missing from Config.qml.
- **Kitty tab bar colors**: Update live via SIGUSR1 and atomic symlink swap.
- **WaffleConfig stale reference**: Removed UI control for deleted `blurStatic` config key.

### Performance
- **Animation instances**: Replaced 402 `createObject` calls with inline `Animation` instances, eliminating per-animation QObject allocation overhead.
- **Blur GPU gating**: Style-gated `layer.enabled` and `source` on all blur Images — GPU blur work only runs when the active style uses it. Reduced `blurMax` from 100 to 64.
- **Wallpaper caching**: `cache:false` on all wallpaper Images across both families with `sourceSize` constraints to cap decoded pixmap resolution.
- **Thumbnail caching**: Skip `magick` subprocess when thumbnail is already loaded; cache `magick identify` results.
- **Crossfader optimization**: `cache:false` on crossfader slots, release inactive slot texture after transition completes.
- **ColorQuantizer gating**: Only run wallpaper ColorQuantizer when aurora/angel style is active.

## [2.10.1] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Desktop right-click context menu**: Right-click on the desktop background opens a context menu with Mission Center, Overview/Task View, Settings, Wallpaper Selector, Terminal, Media Controls, Lock Screen, and Power Menu

- **DesktopShellContextMenu component**: Reusable context menu widget for desktop backgrounds, respects all three global styles (Material, Aurora, iNiR)

### Changed
- **Bar context menu positioning**: Vertical bar popup opens toward screen center (right when bar is left, left when bar is right) following the dock pattern; horizontal bar popup opens above when bar is at bottom, below when at top
- **Desktop context menu close behavior**: Left-click on desktop closes the menu; right-click repositions it — avoids layer-shell backdrop conflict on Niri

## [2.10.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Multi-monitor wallpaper support**: Per-monitor wallpaper and backdrop paths via WallpaperListener service
- **Video first-frame system**: Automatic ffmpeg extraction and caching of first-frame JPGs for video wallpapers
- **Per-monitor aurora/glass**: Bar, dock, and sidebars use per-screen wallpaper for blur and color quantization
- **Wallpaper selector multi-monitor targeting**: Auto-detects focused monitor, opens on target screen, per-monitor selection

- **Card scaling quality**: `layer.smooth` on scaled cards for sharper text and badges when zoomed out
- **Video/GIF display**: Always load AnimatedImage for GIFs (frozen when animation disabled); replaced QtMultimedia Video with first-frame Image in previews
- **Color pipeline**: ColorQuantizer and effectiveWallpaperUrl return image-safe sources for videos (first-frame cache → config thumbnail → trigger generation)
- **switchwall.sh**: Per-monitor wallpaper changes skip global color regeneration; `--noswitch` reads current wallpaper from config
- **CryptoWidget**: Cache staleness check — only refresh if older than refreshInterval (default 300s)
- **WaffleConfig**: Use `Config.setNestedValue()` instead of direct property mutation

### Fixed
- **Black peaks on cards**: Gradient and label overlays no longer escape rounded corners (`clip:true` only clips rectangular)
- **Aurora colors for video wallpapers**: ColorQuantizer receives first-frame images instead of undecoded video URLs
- **Backdrop changes all monitors**: Per-monitor backdrop selection now only affects the selected monitor
- **White line above wallpaper path**: Removed hardcoded separator — `Layout.topMargin` provides sufficient spacing
- **Derive theme colors noop**: Toggle now wires through to Appearance.qml ColorQuantizer, Wallpapers.effectiveWallpaperPath, and switchwall.sh matugen source
