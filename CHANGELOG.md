# Changelog

All notable changes to iNiR will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.17.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **SDDM session popup selector**: Session switcher on the login screen now opens a popup list instead of blindly cycling through entries.
- **CLI command forwarding**: `inir config`, `inir info`, `inir backup`, and `inir logs` forwarded through the launcher to the setup TUI.
- **TUI library expansion**: Rich chooser menus, task progress tracker, key-value detail views, and section helpers for setup subcommands.

### Fixed
- **Dock/taskbar icon resolution**: Reverse-lookup maps in AppSearch match Electron, AppImage, and reverse-domain window IDs to their desktop entries (#105).
- **Backdrop hideWallpaper gate**: `hideWallpaper` now respects `backdrop.enable` instead of firing unconditionally (#104).
- **Repo-link version detection**: `get_installed_version()` and `get_installed_commit()` return live git state for repo-link installs instead of stale `version.json`.
- **Migration 009 modular config**: Handles both monolithic `config.kdl` and post-018 `config.d/40-environment.kdl` layouts for the dbus log spam fix.
- **SDDM theme idempotent copy**: Checksum comparison skips the copy when source and target are already identical.

### Changed
- **PKGBUILD optdepends**: Added `gowall-bin` and `nm-connection-editor`; synced `.SRCINFO`.

### Removed
- **CI workflow**: GitHub Actions workflow removed — not viable on current repo plan.

## [2.17.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Shell entry animation**: Panels slide in on startup with a 400ms delay, and hide during wallpaper coverflow transitions for a cleaner visual flow.
- **Family transition overlay**: Snapshotted color preservation during panel family switches, native iNiR logo, and cleaner Material Design text styling.
- **Steam theming rewrite**: Template-based pipeline with CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) live injection replaces the old Adwaita for Steam approach. Includes visual quality overhaul and real-time color updates.
- **Python-only color pipeline**: Unified Material You color generation using pure Python, removing the external `matugen` binary dependency entirely.
- **MaterialPlaceholderMessage widget**: New M3-style empty-state component replaces `PagePlaceholder` across 17 modules for consistent placeholder messaging.
- **Version divergence warning**: `inir` CLI warns when installed code version doesn't match the running runtime, preventing stale-code confusion after updates.
- **Config directory compatibility layer**: Transparent bridge for the legacy config path, easing future migration without breaking existing setups.
- **v1→v2 manifest upgrade protection**: `setup update` detects and preserves user modifications to runtime files when upgrading manifest versions.
- **Wallpaper selector rewrite**: Skew view rebuilt with blur backdrop overlay, refined exit animation, and shell panel hiding during selection.
- **Alt-tab switcher improvements**: Responsive geometry adapting to window count, Vim-style keybindings (`hjkl`), and `Shape` drop shadows.
- **Control panel enhancements**: State-driven open/close animations, compact mode, and config-driven section visibility.
- **Color strength and accent color config**: Extended schema with `color-strength` and `accent-color` options for finer theming control.
- **Scheme variant control**: Material scheme variant (Content, Expressive, Fidelity, etc.) selection wired into QML theme services.
- **Waffle display scaling**: `dp()` function applied across waffle panel layout dimensions for DPI-aware sizing.
- **CI, code of conduct, and security policy**: GitHub Actions workflow, community standards, and vulnerability reporting process.

### Changed
- **INIR_VENV rename**: Environment variable `ILLOGICAL_IMPULSE_VIRTUAL_ENV` renamed to `INIR_VENV` across all scripts and services (migration 020).
- **Auto scheme detection tuning**: Expressive and Rainbow scheme variants are now much rarer in automatic selection, favoring more predictable palettes.
- **Spotify behavior**: Minimize to tray instead of close; moves to workspace 99 on shell exit to preserve session.
- **Dual-path PopupToolTip**: Tooltip system refactored for both inline and popup rendering paths with migrations across consumers.
- **GTK/KDE/Qt external app theming**: Enhanced template rendering for GTK3/4, KDE kdeglobals, and Qt Darkly color schemes.
- **README and CONTRIBUTING rewrite**: Documentation refreshed for clarity and accuracy.
- **Shebang standardization**: All shell scripts use consistent `#!/usr/bin/env bash` with project-wide shellcheck configuration.
- **iceicerice legacy backend removed**: Old theming backend fully excised in favor of the unified Python pipeline.

### Fixed
- **Workspace numbers per monitor**: Bar workspace indicators now stay local to each screen instead of showing global workspace IDs (#90).
- **Calculator sizing and focus**: Sidebar calculator no longer jitters on resize; focus management stabilized (#99).
- **Niri center lone columns**: Default Niri config centers single columns instead of left-aligning them (#91).
- **Crash restart loop**: Background launcher wrapper detects rapid crash loops and stops respawning after a threshold.
- **Bar module toggle orientation**: Settings toggle for ii bar modules remains orientation-safe regardless of bar position.
- **Migration 017 keybind dedup**: Full launcher path matching prevents false positives in keybind deduplication.
- **kde-material-you-colors wrapper**: Proper process detachment prevents blocking the color pipeline.
- **Spicetify color mapping**: Improved token mapping and prevented Spotify from auto-opening during theme application.

- **GTK CSS symlink safety**: Color pipeline breaks symlinks before writing GTK4 CSS files to prevent cross-contamination.
- **Update version persistence**: Handles empty `version.json` gracefully in update tracking.
- **Avatar binding break**: QtObject resolver pattern prevents property binding loops in avatar component.
- **Settings DropShadow import**: Qualified `DropShadow` with `GE` alias in SettingsOverlay to resolve import ambiguity.
- **Hardcoded path resolution**: Distribution scripts use dynamic paths for AUR and system-wide install compatibility.
- **Running instance detection**: Launcher detects running instance by path to resolve identity mismatches between dev and installed copies.
- **Waffle fluent icons**: Expanded icon mappings for common applications in waffle taskbar.
- **PropertyCache warnings**: Resolved duplicate IPC handler registrations and stale property cache warnings.

- **Bootstrap hardening**: Setup bootstrap and update flow made more resilient against partial failures.

## [2.16.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **AUR-ready Arch packaging**: Complete PKGBUILD ecosystem (`inir-shell-git`, `inir-shell`, `inir-meta`) with 51 dependencies and 37 optional dependencies, `.SRCINFO` generation, and AUR publish workflow. Installs runtime to `/usr/share/quickshell/inir/` with package-managed metadata.
- **Compositor/Niri settings page**: New settings page with scrollable tiling presets, gaps, window rules, decoration, and animation controls.
- **Target-driven palette generation**: Theming pipeline supports target-driven Material You palette extraction for more precise color matching.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Wallpaper pan/zoom**: Reposition and zoom wallpapers within the fill-crop frame with interactive drag-and-scroll settings UI (`background.pan.{x, y, zoom}`).
- **Gowall wallpaper effects**: New `GowallService` and settings editor for wallpaper color manipulation — convert with builtin/custom/Material themes, invert, pixelate, and live preview.
- **Material scheme variant selector**: Choose between Content, Expressive, Fidelity, Monochrome, Neutral, Rainbow, and Tonal Spot color schemes in Control Panel, Waffle Widgets panel, and theme settings pages.
- **InputChip widget**: M3-style compact tag component with optional icon, label, and removable close button.

- **Quick settings redesign**: Hero wallpaper preview with style-aware card, next/random overlay buttons, and improved layout.
- **Waffle system button**: Battery percentage text shown next to icon; network icon filled.
- **Waffle Looks.qml**: Danger/warning colors derived from Material tokens instead of hardcoded values.
- **Color pipeline improvements**: GTK theme application, terminal config generation, material color generation, and Kvantum theming all refined.
- **Launcher restart flow**: `start_background()` uses nohup for proper process detachment; restart via `inir start` instead of direct `qs` exec.

### Fixed
- **Settings direct mutations**: Converted legacy `Config.options` property assignments to `Config.setNestedValue()` in InterfaceConfig (overlay, crosshair, dock settings) and Translator (language persistence).
- **ThumbnailImage path resolution**: Fixed non-absolute path handling and improved URI encoding compliance for thumbnail cache lookup.
- **Scheme variant on manual themes**: Settings pages now use `MaterialThemeLoader.applySchemeVariant()` with seed color for non-auto themes instead of only running `switchwall.sh`.
- **Distribution scripts**: `robust-update.sh`, `snapshots.sh`, and `uninstall.sh` use path-based `qs -p` targeting consistent with the launcher.
- **Super overview daemon**: PID detection matches both legacy `qs -c inir` and path-based `qs -p <path>` process forms.

### Removed
- **OpenCode theme preset**: Removed from ThemePresets (opt-in only via `enableOpenCode` config).

## [2.14.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **`inir` launcher CLI**: Unified daily-use command (`inir run`, `inir restart`, `inir settings`, `inir overview toggle`, etc.) replacing direct `qs` invocation. Supports direct IPC shorthand, maintenance delegation, systemd service management, and version inspection.

- **Desktop entry**: `inir.desktop` for XDG application launchers.
- **DMS-style install surface**: Root `Makefile` with `make install`/`make uninstall` for system-level deployment.
- **Arch Linux packaging**: First-class PKGBUILDs for `inir-shell`, `inir-shell-git`, and `inir-meta` under `distro/arch/`.
- **Modular Niri config**: Default Niri configuration split into `config.d/` fragments (input, layout, window-rules, environment, startup, animations, binds, layer-rules, user-extra).
- **Migration 016**: Converts legacy `qs`/`ii`-era Niri keybindings to the `inir` launcher.
- **Migration 017**: Deduplicates hardware keybinds (brightness/media) that accumulated from prior migration bugs.
- **Migration 018**: Automatically splits monolithic Niri configs into the modular `config.d/` layout.
- **Install/update metadata model**: Runtime metadata now records `installMode`, `updateStrategy`, `repoPath`, `source` for package-aware lifecycle management.
- **Manifest-driven file sync**: Install and update flows now use `sdata/runtime-payload-dirs.txt` and `sdata/runtime-root-files.txt` instead of hard-coded rsync patterns.

### Changed
- **Dark mode toggles**: Routed through `MaterialThemeLoader` to ensure a reliable `colors.json` reload after switching.
- **Style selection**: No longer forces `appearance.transparency.enable` when selecting styles.
- **Color system modularized**: `applycolor.sh` rewritten from monolithic script to modular dispatcher with individual modules (terminals, GTK, Qt, Spicetify, SDDM) and shared runtime library.
- **Shell RC namespace**: Setup-managed shell integration files moved from `~/.config/ii/` to `~/.config/inir/`; existing RC includes are migrated in place.
- **Setup behavior for packaged installs**: `setup status`, `setup update`, `setup rollback`, and `setup uninstall` now detect externally-managed installs and provide appropriate guidance instead of assuming repo-based updates.
- **Shell lifecycle commands**: Internal kill/restart/IPC flows use path-based `qs -p <path>` targeting instead of config-name-based `qs -c inir`.
- **Alt-Switcher refactor**: Major refactoring of both ii and waffle alt-switcher components with expanded configuration options.
- **Niri keybinds documentation**: Complete rewrite of `docs/KEYBINDS.md`.

### Fixed
- **Cloudflare WARP toggle**: Periodic status polling to stay in sync.
- **EasyEffects sink control**: Volume/mute resolves to the physical sink when EasyEffects is the default sink.
- **Wallpaper transitions**: New wallpaper changes fast-forward an in-progress transition; background widget placement is debounced.
- **VS Code Material Code theming**: Respects `appearance.wallpaperTheming.enableVSCode`.
- **Waffle user avatar**: More reliable fallback loading.
- **Waffle settings UI**: Improved loading indicator and multiple polish fixes.
- **Weather location privacy**: Toggle now synchronized across all shell surfaces (bar, overview, lock screen, sidebar, control panel) instead of only affecting the Control Panel card.
- **Weather payload parsing**: Updated to handle current `wttr.in` nested response shape (`data.current_condition`).
- **GameMode toast suppression**: Fullscreen/gamemode states now suppress desktop toasts.
- **Waffle "Colors only" preview**: Persists and previews correctly; clears stale preview state when disabled.
- **Migration target file creation**: Required migrations that create their own target file are no longer skipped.
- **WaffleConfig direct mutation**: Legacy settings writes converted from direct `Config.options` mutation to `Config.setNestedValue()`.
- **Stale `qs -c inir` references**: Setup scripts (robust-update, snapshots, uninstall) and daemon now use path-based targeting consistent with the launcher.
- **Sandbox leak in uninstall**: `Darkly.colors` paths now use `XDG_DATA_HOME` instead of hardcoded `$HOME/.local/share`.

## [2.13.2] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Notepad action**: Quick-open the sidebar notepad.
- **EasyEffects toggle**: Enable/disable audio equalizer from action mode.
- **Wallpaper Coverflow action**: Open the coverflow wallpaper selector alongside the existing grid selector.
- **Zoom controls**: Zoom In, Zoom Out, and Reset Zoom actions for accessibility.
- **On-Screen Keyboard toggle**: Show/hide OSK from action mode.
- **Panel family switching**: Switch between ii and waffle panel families from the palette.
- **Paru package manager support**: All package actions (install, remove, update) detect and use paru as AUR helper alongside yay.
- **Todo feedback**: Adding a todo now shows a desktop notification confirming the task was added, with usage hint when no text provided.

- **Keyboard navigation hints footer**: Shows keybind hints (↑↓ Navigate, ↵ Run, Tab/←→ Category, Esc Close) at the bottom of the action panel for discoverability.

### Changed
- **Wallpaper selector split**: "Change Wallpaper" action now explicitly labeled as Grid or Coverflow, each closing the other before opening.
- **AUR badge theming**: Replaced hardcoded `#1793d1` color with `Appearance.colors.colPrimary` / `Appearance.inir.colPrimary` tokens for proper style-aware rendering.
- **System update action**: Now auto-detects yay/paru/pacman instead of using a hardcoded command.
- **Package install action**: Uses runtime AUR helper detection (`yay > paru > sudo pacman`) instead of hardcoded `yay`.
- **Tab bar spacing**: Added horizontal margins (12px) and increased indicator padding (12px) for proper visual separation between category tabs.
- **Package action refactor**: Deduplicated package install/remove logic into `_executePackageActionStatic` with value capture before component destruction.

### Fixed
- **iNiR style icon**: Replaced invalid "spark" Material Symbol with "terminal" for the Style: iNiR action.
- **Left/Right arrows in search input**: Removed Left/Right arrow key interception from SearchBar to prevent conflict with text cursor movement. Category cycling from search now uses Tab/Shift+Tab only; Left/Right remain available from the action list delegates where there is no text cursor conflict.
- **Up arrow on first item**: Pressing Up on the first action list item now returns focus to the search input via `returnToSearch` signal.
- **Escape key**: Pressing Escape from within the action list now closes the overview.
- **ReferenceError on action execute**: Refactored `onClicked` to capture action/package references before closing the overview, preventing use-after-destroy crashes.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Backdrop wallpaper transitions**: Both ii and waffle backdrops now use `WallpaperCrossfader` for smooth wallpaper transition animations matching their workspace counterparts.
- **Animated blur toggle**: New `enableAnimatedBlur` config key for GIF/video wallpapers in both families.
- **Blur transition suppression**: Blur fades out before wallpaper transitions so the change is visible even with windows open, then fades back in after transition completes.
- **Waffle backdrop effects controls**: Vignette, saturation, contrast, and animated blur controls added to waffle backdrop settings.
- **Waffle transition config**: Independent transition settings for waffle wallpapers (`waffles.background.transition`).
- **Spicetify wallpaper theming**: Opt-in Material You color scheme for Spotify via Spicetify with live watch mode — colors update on wallpaper change without restarting Spotify (PR #80 by @yukazakiri).
- **Migration 013**: Auto-patch kde-material-you-colors wrapper on update.
- **Migration 014**: Malloc arena optimization (`MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2`, `MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_=131072`) for reduced glibc memory overhead.
- **Migration 015**: Clean orphan config keys (`blurStatic`, `videoBlurStrength` → `thumbnailBlurStrength`) from existing user configs.

### Changed
- **Blur decoupled from awww renderer**: Blur now reads from the crossfader texture regardless of who renders the visible wallpaper, fixing blur not working when parallax is disabled.
- **blurStatic removed**: Blur only activates when windows are present on the workspace. The always-on `blurStatic` option caused rendering issues in both families and has been removed.
- **videoBlurStrength → thumbnailBlurStrength**: Renamed for clarity; migration preserves user values.
- **Saturation/contrast defaults**: Changed from 1.0 to 0 (neutral) for new installs. Existing users keep their values.
- **Backend provider hardcoded**: `awww` backend is now always active (config key ignored, no UI change).
- **Settings surfaces refreshed**: Updated quick options, control panel, and shell surfaces.

### Fixed
- **Wallpaper double-apply**: Prevent duplicate `switchwall.sh` runs with `_applyInProgress` suppression flag and 3-second timer.
- **kde-material-you-colors stacking**: Kill previous daemon instance before launching new one to prevent orphan processes.
- **StyledListView animations**: Use `Transition.enabled` instead of `running` on child animations to prevent animation glitches.
- **Blur alignment**: Reverted `sourceSize÷4` to screen resolution for correct blur positioning.
- **Blur source loading**: Keep wallpaper source always loaded to avoid style-switch freeze.
- **Todo.qml runtime error**: Replaced invalid `Process.exec` with `Quickshell.execDetached`.
- **Config schema sync**: Added `enableOpenCode`, `vscodeEditors` (14 editor forks), and `omp` (oh-my-posh) to schema and defaults — keys existed in theming scripts but were missing from Config.qml.
- **Kitty tab bar colors**: Update live via SIGUSR1 and atomic symlink swap.
- **WaffleConfig stale reference**: Removed UI control for deleted `blurStatic` config key.

### Performance
- **Animation instances**: Replaced 402 `createObject` calls with inline `Animation` instances, eliminating per-animation QObject allocation overhead.
- **Blur GPU gating**: Style-gated `layer.enabled` and `source` on all blur Images — GPU blur work only runs when the active style uses it. Reduced `blurMax` from 100 to 64.
- **Wallpaper caching**: `cache:false` on all wallpaper Images across both families with `sourceSize` constraints to cap decoded pixmap resolution.
- **Thumbnail caching**: Skip `magick` subprocess when thumbnail is already loaded; cache `magick identify` results.
- **Crossfader optimization**: `cache:false` on crossfader slots, release inactive slot texture after transition completes.
- **ColorQuantizer gating**: Only run wallpaper ColorQuantizer when aurora/angel style is active.

### Fixed
- **SDDM password characters blinking**: Password shape indicators no longer re-animate when typing new characters. Replaced integer Repeater model (which recreates all delegates) with ListModel (preserves existing delegates). Matches lockscreen behavior.
- **Cheatsheet style consistency**: Added angel and aurora style branches to keybind rows and periodic table cards for proper 5-style support.
- **SongRec music recognition**: Updated command from deprecated `audio-file-to-recognized-song` to `recognize -j` for compatibility with newer songrec versions.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **SDDM Pixel theme**: Material You login screen — session selector, cycling fail messages, wallpaper-synced colors. Auto-applied on fresh install.
- **Angel global style**: Fifth visual style (neo-brutalism glass) across all shell surfaces
- **Firefox MaterialFox theming**: Auto-generated Material You colors for Firefox via matugen template
- **Terminal theming: btop, lazygit, yazi**: 10 TUI tools now auto-theme with wallpaper colors (foot, kitty, alacritty, starship, fuzzel, pywalfox, btop, lazygit, yazi). Individual toggles in Settings.
- **Terminal color controls**: Saturation and brightness sliders for fine-tuning generated terminal colors
- **Overlay theming options**: Scrim dim, background opacity, and blur toggle in Settings
- **Waffle per-monitor wallpaper**: Full UI with monitor frame preview + thumbnail grid in Waffle settings

### Changed
- **Color pipeline centralized**: Matugen generates `colors.json` only; Python handles all app configs (GTK, KDE, terminals, Vesktop, Fuzzel) — consistent primary color across everything
- **Qt theming via plasma-integration**: Required dependency for Material You in Qt apps. Migration 011 auto-patches existing installs. New doctor check verifies it's working.
- **darkly → darkly-bin**: Pre-built binary on Arch saves ~5 min on fresh install
- **Setup TUI overhaul**: Consistent `log_*/tui_*` branding across Arch, Debian, and Fedora installers
- **GTK4 dark mode**: Template applies dark mode unconditionally
- **Dolphin integration**: SingleClick mode + "Open terminal here" context menu via kservicemenurc
- **quickshell-git conflict**: Installer handles existing `-git` package, prefers official repos; adds ffmpeg as dependency

### Fixed
- **Terminal colors not updating**: Root cause — venv activation failed in QML `execDetached` context when `ILLOGICAL_IMPULSE_VIRTUAL_ENV` was unset
- **SDDM Qt5 compatibility**: Full rewrite for SDDM's Qt5 runtime (model roles, easing curves, font loading)
- **Wallpaper theming**: Stop guessing thumbnails by basename, clear stale paths on video→image switch, kill previous switchwall before starting new
- **Video first-frame**: `seek(0)` after pause ensures frame display
- **Qt apps white on dark**: Fixed GTK4 CSS and terminal venv resolution for Nautilus and KDE apps
- **Waffle notifications**: Expand direction, calendar lag, animation cleanup
- **Pomodoro timer**: Timer editing no longer requires double-tap
- **Settings search**: Improved result relevance — dynamic registry results scored higher, section delimiter parsing unified
- **Capture windows**: No longer trashes clipboard during screenshot
- **Foot colors**: Switched to `inir-colors.ini`, removed stale `colors.ini` include
- **Matugen config**: Use user config at `~/.config/matugen/`, not non-existent defaults path
- **Config safety audit**: 34 fixes — unsafe writes→`setNestedValue()`, unsafe reads→safe defaults
- **Waffle video backdrop**: Show frozen first frame when animated wallpapers disabled (was showing nothing)
- **Fresh install**: 0-byte wallpaper recovery, version.json tracking, polkit auto-detection, env vars in all shells, conflict auto-disable, dynamic wallpaper selection

## [2.10.1] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Desktop right-click context menu**: Right-click on the desktop background opens a context menu with Mission Center, Overview/Task View, Settings, Wallpaper Selector, Terminal, Media Controls, Lock Screen, and Power Menu
- **Bar right-click context menu (ii family)**: Right-click on the horizontal or vertical bar opens a context menu with Mission Center and Settings
- **DesktopShellContextMenu component**: Reusable context menu widget for desktop backgrounds, respects all three global styles (Material, Aurora, iNiR)

### Changed
- **Bar context menu positioning**: Vertical bar popup opens toward screen center (right when bar is left, left when bar is right) following the dock pattern; horizontal bar popup opens above when bar is at bottom, below when at top
- **Desktop context menu close behavior**: Left-click on desktop closes the menu; right-click repositions it — avoids layer-shell backdrop conflict on Niri

## [2.10.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Multi-monitor wallpaper support**: Per-monitor wallpaper and backdrop paths via WallpaperListener service
- **Video first-frame system**: Automatic ffmpeg extraction and caching of first-frame JPGs for video wallpapers
- **Per-monitor aurora/glass**: Bar, dock, and sidebars use per-screen wallpaper for blur and color quantization
- **Wallpaper selector multi-monitor targeting**: Auto-detects focused monitor, opens on target screen, per-monitor selection
- **Per-monitor backdrop paths**: Each monitor can have its own backdrop wallpaper independent of global setting
- **Derive theme colors from backdrop**: New toggle in settings — all color generation sources (matugen, ColorQuantizer, aurora) switch to backdrop wallpaper when enabled
- **Card right-click swap**: Right-click on the front card toggles between main wallpaper and backdrop views
- **Backdrop card focus borders**: Selection border overlay when backdrop card is in front and selected
- **DockPreview toplevel reactivity**: Auto-close preview when app exits, update on toplevel changes
- **Per-monitor random wallpapers**: Random wallpaper scripts (konachan, osu) support focused monitor targeting

### Changed
- **Card clipping**: Parent-level `layer.enabled + OpacityMask` replaces per-image masking — all children (gradients, labels, badges) now properly clip to rounded corners
- **Card scaling quality**: `layer.smooth` on scaled cards for sharper text and badges when zoomed out
- **Video/GIF display**: Always load AnimatedImage for GIFs (frozen when animation disabled); replaced QtMultimedia Video with first-frame Image in previews
- **Color pipeline**: ColorQuantizer and effectiveWallpaperUrl return image-safe sources for videos (first-frame cache → config thumbnail → trigger generation)
- **switchwall.sh**: Per-monitor wallpaper changes skip global color regeneration; `--noswitch` reads current wallpaper from config
- **CryptoWidget**: Cache staleness check — only refresh if older than refreshInterval (default 300s)
- **WaffleConfig**: Use `Config.setNestedValue()` instead of direct property mutation

### Fixed
- **Black peaks on cards**: Gradient and label overlays no longer escape rounded corners (`clip:true` only clips rectangular)
- **Aurora colors for video wallpapers**: ColorQuantizer receives first-frame images instead of undecoded video URLs
- **Backdrop changes all monitors**: Per-monitor backdrop selection now only affects the selected monitor
- **White line above wallpaper path**: Removed hardcoded separator — `Layout.topMargin` provides sufficient spacing
- **Derive theme colors noop**: Toggle now wires through to Appearance.qml ColorQuantizer, Wallpapers.effectiveWallpaperPath, and switchwall.sh matugen source

- **Settings bugs**: Fixed BarConfig layout property name, WaffleConfig bindings and spacing
- **YtMusic persistence**: Connection state and resolvedBrowserArg now persist across restarts
- **YtMusic cookies**: Always use --cookies-from-browser instead of intermediate cookie files, resolve Firefox fork profile paths

- **Hardcoded animations**: Replaced raw `NumberAnimation`/`ColorAnimation` with `Appearance.animation` and `Looks.transition` design tokens across TimerIndicator, KeyboardKey, BarMediaPlayerItem, ThemePresetCard, TilingOverlay, and WidgetsContent
- **Screen cast settings**: Added null safety, `setNestedValue` for output field, synced defaults with Config.qml schema
