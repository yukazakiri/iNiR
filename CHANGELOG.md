## [2.20.0] - 2026-04-11

Community contributions edition. Turns out people actually use this thing and want to make it better. Who knew.

### Added
- **YTMusic "Up Next" notifications** ([@SecArt1](https://github.com/SecArt1)): When a track auto-advances, a transient notification shows what's coming next. Suppressed during gamemode and fullscreen. Configurable via `sidebar.ytmusic.upNextNotifications` and `sidebar.ytmusic.suppressUpNextInFullscreen`. *(PR #111)*
- **Zed editor Go-based theme pipeline** ([@yukazakiri](https://github.com/yukazakiri)): Zed theming split into its own module (`31-zed.sh`) with a compiled Go generator for significantly faster theme generation. Supports variant-based themes and input signature caching to skip redundant rebuilds. *(PR #98)*
- **Neovim/LazyVim wallpaper theming** ([@yukazakiri](https://github.com/yukazakiri)): Generates an `aether.nvim` colorscheme plugin that maps Material 3 palette to Neovim highlight groups. Includes file watchers for live hot-reload when colors change. *(PR #103)*
- **Equicord theme support** ([@yukazakiri](https://github.com/yukazakiri)): System24 theme generation now discovers Equicord config directories alongside standard Discord client paths. *(PR #100)*

### Fixed
- **Battery info display** ([@orcusforyou](https://github.com/orcusforyou)): Fixed wrong battery percentage and status shown in the Overview dashboard and Control Panel. Turns out displaying the correct number matters. *(PR #95)*
- **Spicetify playback theme refresh** ([@yukazakiri](https://github.com/yukazakiri)): Playback CSS color blocks now properly rewrite on theme changes instead of going stale. *(PR #101)*
- **YTMusic double-advance race condition**: Fixed a timing bug where the old mpv process exiting during the play-delay window would trigger a second `playNext()`, sending two "Up Next" notifications and skipping a track. The `_userInitiatedPlay` guard now stays active until the new mpv confirms started.
- **Zed theme rebuild detection**: The Go binary now checks timestamps of `main.go`, `common.go`, and `go.mod` before running, preventing a stale binary from silently succeeding and caching the input signature.

### Improved
- **pt-BR translations** ([@Guilherme4Colamarco](https://github.com/Guilherme4Colamarco)): 651 human-written translations replacing auto-generated ones, plus 38 new keys. Fixed broken `%1` format string placeholders that had spaces injected by machine translation. Total coverage: 3435 keys. *(PR #97)*

### Contributors
Shoutout to [@yukazakiri](https://github.com/yukazakiri) for basically adopting the color pipeline this release (4 PRs!), [@SecArt1](https://github.com/SecArt1) for the YTMusic notify feature, [@orcusforyou](https://github.com/orcusforyou) for catching the battery display bug, and [@Guilherme4Colamarco](https://github.com/Guilherme4Colamarco) for making pt-BR speakers not suffer through Google Translate's interpretation of UI strings.

## [2.19.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Live update progress**: Setup writes structured progress markers (`progress:STEP:TOTAL:MSG`) during updates. ShellUpdates.qml polls the status file every 2s, parsing step/total/message into reactive properties. UI shows a spinner with step counter (e.g. 3/7) during updates. Watchdog staleness detection prevents infinite timeout on stuck updates.
- **Sidebar drop, swing, and elastic animations**: Three new sidebar open/close animation types in addition to the existing slide/fade/pop/reveal — drop (vertical slide from above with fade), swing (horizontal scale from edge), and elastic (overshoot bounce with scale). Widget stagger animation intensity reduced for subtler startup.
- **YTMusic session resume**: Playback state (URL, position, title, etc.) persisted to config every 5s while playing. On shell restart, the last session is restored automatically if playback was active. New `Config.setNestedValues()` batch function prevents multiple config-change emissions during multi-key writes.
- **WAYLAND_DISPLAY auto-detection**: `apply_qt_runtime_env` now probes `/run/user/<uid>/wayland-*` when `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is unset — prevents Qt XCB fallback crash on boot-time systemd starts where the compositor hasn't exported the variable yet. `ensure_systemd_graphical_env` added to the bare `start` code path.
- **Waffle theme settings parity**: Color strength slider, soften colors toggle, and terminal color adjustment sliders (saturation, brightness, harmony, background brightness) with reset button added to WThemesPage — matches ii's ThemesConfig feature set.
- **Waffle font selector widget**: New `WSettingsFontSelector` component — searchable popup over all installed system fonts with featured fonts pinned at top. Used for desktop clock font selection, replacing the previous hardcoded 5-option choice group.

### Changed
- **Dock indicator dots redesign**: Focused dot is now wider (pill shape) with accent color per visual style (angel/inir/aurora/material). Unfocused dots are narrow and dimmed. Fallback dim dot shown for inactive apps when `showAllWindowDots` is off. Config properties hoisted to root for reuse. Vertical-mode anchor overrides removed (unused in current dock modes).
- **Module list sync**: iiShellUpdate added to ii family, iiTilingOverlay moved from waffle shared to ii-only, iiControlPanel removed from waffle shared. Module lists in ModulesConfig.qml synced with shell.qml. DockAppButton pear-desktop app ID updated. `enablePearDesktop` enabled by default.
- **Pear Desktop package detection**: Auto-detect whether `youtube-music` (CachyOS) or `pear-desktop` (AUR) is installed instead of hardcoding one name. CDP port changed from 9222 to 9223 to avoid spicetify conflict.
- **Fresh install defaults**: Material settings UI defaults to overlay mode. Waffle activation watermark enabled by default. Waffle widgets panel slimmed to DateTime + Weather + Media (System, QuickActions, ColorScheme disabled). Wallpaper transition type defaults to random instead of crossfade. Waffle desktop clock font defaults to Roboto Flex.
- **Fresh install packages**: gowall-bin and mission-center added to Arch AUR packages. mission-center added to deps-map for all distros (flatpak fallback). SDDM theme prompt defaults to yes.
- **Waffle background settings order**: Desktop Clock card moved to end of WBackgroundPage — wallpaper controls, effects, and backdrop come first.

### Fixed
- **Dock preview popup stability**: ScriptModel `objectProp` with stable `previewKey` prevents delegate recreation on model rebuild (fixes icon flash). 500ms close grace period prevents popup closure when resizing after closing a window moves the cursor outside bounds. Removed stale `syncVisibleWindows`/`maybeCaptureMissingPreviews` machinery — replaced by simple `onLiveToplevelsChanged` auto-close. Closing animation removed for immediate response.
- **SDDM theme.conf self-heal**: Detects missing `[General]` section or `background=` directive in corrupted theme.conf and restores the canonical template before applying color values.
- **Config bool false values in color pipeline**: jq's `//` operator treats `false` as null, causing `config_bool` to return the fallback instead of the actual `false` value. Uses explicit null check now.
- **Setup flag ordering**: `-y`/`-q` flags moved before the `update` subcommand in the re-exec path so the global parser picks them up. POSIX TTY detection (`[ -t 0 ]`) added as defense-in-depth — non-interactive mode auto-forced when no terminal is attached.
- **GameMode fullscreen detection**: Focused window lookup switched from stale `activeWindow` to `NiriService.windows` array — catches F11 without focus change. Fixed `stateReader.path` where `Qt.resolvedUrl()` on an absolute filesystem path mangled the path, preventing FileView from emitting signals and disabling all detection connections. Input mask across Bar, Dock, VerticalBar, WaffleBar, and Overlay replaced with explicit zero-size emptyMask Item.
- **Systemd KillMode**: Switched from `KillMode=control-group` to `KillMode=process` so apps launched by the shell (mpv, browsers, etc.) survive shell restart.
- **Overview search layout without dashboard**: Workspace grid loader now hides from Column layout during search, preventing vertical centering breakage and results pushed to top of screen.
- **Overview wallpaper without effects**: Workspace thumbnails render unblurred with OpacityMask fallback when `Appearance.effectsEnabled` is false — previously no wallpaper showed at all.
- **Media player selection**: Fixed player selection logic and scroll volume consistency.
- **Waffle dark mode toggle**: Was calling switchwall.sh directly, bypassing MaterialThemeLoader's force-apply gate — preset themes silently ignored mode changes. Now routes through `MaterialThemeLoader.setDarkMode()`.
- **Double palette type regeneration**: Palette type changes in both ii and waffle settings fired switchwall.sh immediately AND through ThemeService's 260ms debounce, causing a race condition. Removed redundant direct calls — ThemeService's `liveRegenSignature` handles auto-theme regeneration automatically.
- **Terminal color adjustment defaults**: ThemesConfig preview and spinbox fallbacks mismatched Config schema — saturation showed 40% instead of 65%, brightness 55% instead of 60%, harmony preview used 0.15 instead of 0.40.
- **Waffle taskbar task manager icon**: Icon name `monitoring` didn't exist in the fluent icon set, rendering blank. Changed to `pulse`.

## [2.18.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Systemd shell startup**: Shell startup migrated from niri `spawn-at-startup` to a systemd user service (`inir.service`). Migration 021 handles the transition — removes compositor startup lines, installs and enables the service. `KillMode=process` prevents systemd from terminating child apps on shell restart.
- **CLI discoverability overhaul**: Rich `--help` with dynamic IPC target listing by panel family, per-target `--help`, typo suggestions, function validation. New shell completions for bash, zsh, and fish. IPC registry generated from source with `generate-ipc-registry.py`.
- **Waffle settings redesign**: Complete Fluent-styled redesign of Quick Settings, Background, Themes, Interface, Modules, Bar, Shortcuts, and Waffle Style pages. New shared components: `WSettingsSection`, `WSettingsSlider`, `WSettingsInfoBar`, `WSettingsChoiceGroup`.
- **Gowall wallpaper editor**: New gowall page in waffle settings with theme browser, preview, and apply. Apply routes by active panel family. Shim dir prevents gowall from spawning image viewers after processing.
- **Pear Desktop theming**: New color module (`80-pear-desktop.sh`) with live CSS injection via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Config toggle `enablePearDesktop` with settings UI integration.
- **All-apps grid view**: Grid layout with letter jump strip added to waffle start menu.
- **Overview active-screen-only**: New `overview.activeScreenOnly` config option — shows overview only on the focused monitor in multi-monitor setups.
- **Equicord Discord client support**: Vesktop theme generation now includes `~/.config/equicord/` and `~/.config/Equicord/` paths.

### Changed
- **GameMode rewrite**: Replaced size-based fullscreen heuristic (60px margin) with niri's native `is_fullscreen` flag. New `shouldHidePanels` property — panels only hide when auto-detected AND focused window is fullscreen. Manual GameMode never hides panels. Eliminates false positives on maximized windows with small gaps.
- **Context-aware panel hiding**: Bar, Dock, and VerticalBar use `GameMode.shouldHidePanels` instead of blunt `GameMode.active`. Panels return when user opens Niri overview. Input regions (mask + exclusiveZone) nullified during gamemode to prevent invisible mouse traps.
- **Unified external theming**: Manual preset themes now fan out through the same `applycolor.sh` pipeline as wallpaper auto-generation. 120ms debounced timer ensures FileView flush before script execution. All targets (terminals, editors, chrome, spicetify, steam, pear) stay in sync.
- **GTK/Qt theme overhaul**: Selection colors changed from raw accent to blended surface tones. New hover/active/focus interaction states for buttons, menus, and entries. Added `Colors:Header` section for Darkly. qt6ct/qt5ct config generation hardened.
- **Parallax defaults**: Disabled by default for fresh installs. Zoom values normalized to 1.0 — headroom is now applied internally by the parallax engine.
- **ThemeService family awareness**: Detects `panelFamily` change and re-runs full color pipeline even for manual themes. Waffle wallpaper apply now triggers color regeneration.
- **Terminal color generation**: WCAG contrast-aware tone search prevents low-contrast terminal output. Tone capping prevents whitewash on bright colors. Force-dark terminal mode generates isolated `terminal.json`.
- **Discord theme rename**: Vesktop/midnight themes renamed from `ii-midnight` to `inir-midnight`. Subtler hover/active states, refined mention gradients, softer borders. Legacy CSS auto-cleaned on next color generation.
- **Compact sidebar media**: Redesigned media player and controls cards layout.
- **Bar/dock stale monitor guard**: Screen filter fallback prevents stale monitor names (e.g. after VRR re-enumeration) from hiding all panels.
- **Steam/Pear reload safety**: Removed `pkill` fallbacks for steamwebhelper and youtube-music. Apps are never force-killed — CSS deploys to disk and applies on next app restart.

### Fixed
- **Gowall waffle apply bleeding into ii**: Apply now routes by active panel family and restores waffle color regen.
- **Looks.ensureMinOpacity null guard**: `Qt.color()` returns null, not an invalid object — guard updated.
- **Gowall opening image viewer**: Shim dir with no-op `kitty`/`xdg-open` prevents unwanted window spawns.
- **WaffleWidgets layer**: Changed to `Top` with missing `WButton` import added.
- **Broken fluent icons in WInterfacePage**: Missing `WButton` import restored.
- **Glass opacity floor**: Enforced minimum for waffle aurora/angel surfaces.
- **Overview vertical centering**: Replaced anchor-based centering with calculated `topMargin` approach to prevent subpixel blur and erratic positioning.
- **Volume OSD on gamemode activation**: Prevented spurious OSD trigger during gamemode state change.
- **Slider handle-track desync**: Fixed during drag interaction, added tabular numbers for consistent width.
- **Parallax sizing and crossfader artifacts**: Reworked transition logic and hardened skew selector sync.
- **Click-outside backdrops**: Declarative visibility prevents orphaned input capture layers.
- **Niri output key rejection**: Compositor settings backend now rejects unsupported output keys.
- **Volume controls after output switch**: Fixed, with easyeffects crash avoidance.
- **Alacritty migration**: Hoisted misplaced `live_config_reload` key.
- **Duplicate inir instances**: Guard on `inir run`, kill foreground wrappers on stop, loop `qs kill` for multi-instance cleanup.
- **Foot terminal colors**: Switched to `[colors-dark]` section to drop deprecation spam.
- **Keyboard layout save key**: Fixed save path, stopped language fallback to `en_US`.
- **Theme regen consistency**: Aligned regeneration across settings, family switch, and external targets.
- **Preset theme color propagation**: Fixed propagation to external apps and family switch regen.
- **Fullscreen surface handling**: Unmap all shell surfaces during fullscreen for direct scanout.
### Removed
- **`overview.centerLauncher`**: Config option removed — overview always uses calculated vertical centering.
- **`spawn-at-startup` compositor entry**: Shell startup ownership moved to systemd user service.

## [2.17.4] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Complete Internationalization**: 14 new languages fully translated with 3400+ keys each (es_AR, fr_FR, de_DE, it_IT, pt_BR, ru_RU, uk_UA, hi_IN, ar_SA, he_HE, zh_CN, ja_JP, ko_KR, vi_VN).
- **Translation Auto-Updater**: Added `translations/tools/auto-translate.js` script to bulk translate missing keys via Google Translate API without hitting limits.

### Changed
- **Bug Report Template**: Updated GitHub issue templates to require explicit Qt, Quickshell, and Distro version fields for better debugging.

### Fixed
- **Niri Display Config State**: Fixed combo box bindings breaking after user interaction. State is now imperatively resynced after output data refreshes, and reads are deferred by 300ms to avoid stale values.
- **Settings Status Banner UI**: Improved the error/info status banner in NiriConfig with distinct colors (error/primary), larger icons, and solid-styled Dismiss/Retry buttons.

## [2.17.3] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Configurable sidebar animations**: Sidebars now support 4 animation types — slide (default), fade, pop, and reveal — selectable from Settings > Panels. Uses Material Design motion tokens with enter/exit transitions.
- **Lock screen video/GIF support**: Video and animated GIF wallpapers now render on the lock screen with first-frame fallback. Animation is off by default (Settings > Lock Screen toggle). Supports both ii and waffle families including the Niri-safe variant.

### Fixed
- **YTMusic track selection race**: Clicking a song while another was playing could advance to the next track instead of the selected one. Added `_userInitiatedPlay` guard to suppress spurious `playNext()` from the old mpv's exit handler during the 200ms handoff window.
- **Cloudflare WARP toggle misalignment**: WARP toggle in the classic quick panel broke grid alignment because its `contentItem` lacked the Item wrapper other toggles use.
- **Classic quick toggles left-aligned in compact mode**: Grid was anchored to left/right edges in compact mode instead of centering. Now always horizontally centered.
- **Waffle lock screen GIF detection**: `wallpaperIsVideo`/`wallpaperIsGif` were checking the thumbnail-resolved path instead of the raw source path, which could miss animated wallpapers when a thumbnail was set.

## [2.17.2] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Arch dependency tracker meta-package**: New `inir-deps` package registered during setup so pacman orphan cleanup does not remove iNiR runtime dependencies.
- **Post-install extras flow**: `./setup extras` now exposes optional installs for iNiR-Walls and ii-pixel-sddm after initial setup.
- **Curated software catalog sidebar tab**: Added software discovery surface with bundled catalog data and AppCatalog service wiring.
- **Material background clock controls**: Added full clock customization for the ii background widget (schema/defaults/settings + widget surfaces).

### Changed
- **Arch install hardening**: Dependency install flow now handles known Noctalia package conflicts before iNiR package resolution.
- **Path model normalization**: Runtime/services/settings/welcome surfaces now consume centralized XDG-derived paths from `Directories.qml` instead of scattered literals.
- **Setup UX flow**: Fresh install keeps optional content opt-in (SDDM/iNiR-Walls), update path handling and theme actions were hardened, and the setup TUI received the new Ink visual refactor.
- **README localization refresh**: Main README and localized docs/readme pages were rewritten/synced for current project messaging.
- **Technical docs sync**: IPC, theming, package, and project-map docs were aligned with real runtime/distribution behavior.

### Fixed
- **Wallpaper status resolution**: Setup now reads `theme-meta.json` via `.wallpaper` with `.source_path` fallback so active wallpaper no longer shows as `none` when metadata uses source-path shape.
- **iNiR-Walls feedback**: Extras flow now shows visible clone/download progress and no longer suppresses user-facing install logs.
- **Theming target wiring**: Spicetify target config key corrected to `appearance.wallpaperTheming.enableSpicetify`, and terminal theming applies with safer terminal ancestry detection.
- **Runtime interaction edge cases**: Cheatsheet key handling and wallpaper coverflow monitor targeting/cleanup were corrected for more reliable focus and close behavior.
- **YTMusic playback/state reliability**: Fixed media source switching sync and autoplay recovery when mpv hangs at EOF.
- **Background media widget blur placement**: Corrected half-pixel placement artifact that caused blur instability.
- **Settings/overlay alignment polish**: Fixed variable-width action tab underline alignment, removed settings nav scrollbar rail bleed, and prevented overlay-mode hover bubble from shifting nav alignment.
- **Anime schedule watch fallback**: Migrated fallback target to 9animetv for broken/legacy watch links.

## [2.17.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **SDDM session popup selector**: Session switcher on the login screen now opens a popup list instead of blindly cycling through entries.
- **CLI command forwarding**: `inir config`, `inir info`, `inir backup`, and `inir logs` forwarded through the launcher to the setup TUI.
- **TUI library expansion**: Rich chooser menus, task progress tracker, key-value detail views, and section helpers for setup subcommands.

### Fixed
- **Dock/taskbar icon resolution**: Reverse-lookup maps in AppSearch match Electron, AppImage, and reverse-domain window IDs to their desktop entries (#105).
- **Backdrop hideWallpaper gate**: `hideWallpaper` now respects `backdrop.enable` instead of firing unconditionally (#104).
- **Repo-link version detection**: `get_installed_version()` and `get_installed_commit()` return live git state for repo-link installs instead of stale `version.json`.
- **Migration 009 modular config**: Handles both monolithic `config.kdl` and post-018 `config.d/40-environment.kdl` layouts for the dbus log spam fix.
- **SDDM theme idempotent copy**: Checksum comparison skips the copy when source and target are already identical.

### Changed
- **PKGBUILD optdepends**: Added `gowall-bin` and `nm-connection-editor`; synced `.SRCINFO`.

### Removed
- **CI workflow**: GitHub Actions workflow removed — not viable on current repo plan.

## [2.17.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Shell entry animation**: Panels slide in on startup with a 400ms delay, and hide during wallpaper coverflow transitions for a cleaner visual flow.
- **Family transition overlay**: Snapshotted color preservation during panel family switches, native iNiR logo, and cleaner Material Design text styling.
- **Steam theming rewrite**: Template-based pipeline with CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) live injection replaces the old Adwaita for Steam approach. Includes visual quality overhaul and real-time color updates.
- **Python-only color pipeline**: Unified Material You color generation using pure Python, removing the external `matugen` binary dependency entirely.
- **MaterialPlaceholderMessage widget**: New M3-style empty-state component replaces `PagePlaceholder` across 17 modules for consistent placeholder messaging.
- **Version divergence warning**: `inir` CLI warns when installed code version doesn't match the running runtime, preventing stale-code confusion after updates.
- **Config directory compatibility layer**: Transparent bridge for the legacy config path, easing future migration without breaking existing setups.
- **v1→v2 manifest upgrade protection**: `setup update` detects and preserves user modifications to runtime files when upgrading manifest versions.
- **Wallpaper selector rewrite**: Skew view rebuilt with blur backdrop overlay, refined exit animation, and shell panel hiding during selection.
- **Alt-tab switcher improvements**: Responsive geometry adapting to window count, Vim-style keybindings (`hjkl`), and `Shape` drop shadows.
- **Control panel enhancements**: State-driven open/close animations, compact mode, and config-driven section visibility.
- **Color strength and accent color config**: Extended schema with `color-strength` and `accent-color` options for finer theming control.
- **Scheme variant control**: Material scheme variant (Content, Expressive, Fidelity, etc.) selection wired into QML theme services.
- **Waffle display scaling**: `dp()` function applied across waffle panel layout dimensions for DPI-aware sizing.
- **CI, code of conduct, and security policy**: GitHub Actions workflow, community standards, and vulnerability reporting process.

### Changed
- **INIR_VENV rename**: Environment variable `ILLOGICAL_IMPULSE_VIRTUAL_ENV` renamed to `INIR_VENV` across all scripts and services (migration 020).
- **Auto scheme detection tuning**: Expressive and Rainbow scheme variants are now much rarer in automatic selection, favoring more predictable palettes.
- **Spotify behavior**: Minimize to tray instead of close; moves to workspace 99 on shell exit to preserve session.
- **Dual-path PopupToolTip**: Tooltip system refactored for both inline and popup rendering paths with migrations across consumers.
- **GTK/KDE/Qt external app theming**: Enhanced template rendering for GTK3/4, KDE kdeglobals, and Qt Darkly color schemes.
- **README and CONTRIBUTING rewrite**: Documentation refreshed for clarity and accuracy.
- **Shebang standardization**: All shell scripts use consistent `#!/usr/bin/env bash` with project-wide shellcheck configuration.
- **iceicerice legacy backend removed**: Old theming backend fully excised in favor of the unified Python pipeline.

### Fixed
- **Workspace numbers per monitor**: Bar workspace indicators now stay local to each screen instead of showing global workspace IDs (#90).
- **Calculator sizing and focus**: Sidebar calculator no longer jitters on resize; focus management stabilized (#99).
- **Niri center lone columns**: Default Niri config centers single columns instead of left-aligning them (#91).
- **Crash restart loop**: Background launcher wrapper detects rapid crash loops and stops respawning after a threshold.
- **Bar module toggle orientation**: Settings toggle for ii bar modules remains orientation-safe regardless of bar position.
- **Migration 017 keybind dedup**: Full launcher path matching prevents false positives in keybind deduplication.
- **kde-material-you-colors wrapper**: Proper process detachment prevents blocking the color pipeline.
- **Spicetify color mapping**: Improved token mapping and prevented Spotify from auto-opening during theme application.
- **YouTube Music OAuth**: Restructured OAuth section out of advanced popup to fix layout overflow.
- **Qt session env preservation**: `inir` CLI no longer unsets Qt environment variables inherited from the session.
- **Theme race conditions**: Serialized shell script writes to `config.json` with `flock`; theme switching sequences properly gated.
- **GTK CSS symlink safety**: Color pipeline breaks symlinks before writing GTK4 CSS files to prevent cross-contamination.
- **Update version persistence**: Handles empty `version.json` gracefully in update tracking.
- **Avatar binding break**: QtObject resolver pattern prevents property binding loops in avatar component.
- **Settings DropShadow import**: Qualified `DropShadow` with `GE` alias in SettingsOverlay to resolve import ambiguity.
- **Hardcoded path resolution**: Distribution scripts use dynamic paths for AUR and system-wide install compatibility.
- **Running instance detection**: Launcher detects running instance by path to resolve identity mismatches between dev and installed copies.
- **Waffle fluent icons**: Expanded icon mappings for common applications in waffle taskbar.
- **PropertyCache warnings**: Resolved duplicate IPC handler registrations and stale property cache warnings.
- **Waffle UI bugs**: Six fixes across widgets, settings, theming, and family transition in waffle panels.

### Removed
- **matugen binary dependency**: Fully replaced by the Python-only color generation pipeline. External `matugen` package is no longer required.
- **Adwaita for Steam script**: `apply-adwsteam-theme.sh` removed, replaced by template-based Steam theming.
- **iceicerice theming backend**: Legacy color backend removed after migration to unified pipeline.
- **Unused config key**: `adwSteamColorTheme` removed from config schema.

### Performance
- **Color output chroma scaling**: Chroma adjustments applied to output tokens instead of seed color for more predictable palette behavior.
- **Doctor diagnostics**: Added missing dependency checks, dynamic Qt path detection, and clearer fix guidance messages.
- **Bootstrap hardening**: Setup bootstrap and update flow made more resilient against partial failures.

## [2.16.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **AUR-ready Arch packaging**: Complete PKGBUILD ecosystem (`inir-shell-git`, `inir-shell`, `inir-meta`) with 51 dependencies and 37 optional dependencies, `.SRCINFO` generation, and AUR publish workflow. Installs runtime to `/usr/share/quickshell/inir/` with package-managed metadata.
- **Compositor/Niri settings page**: New settings page with scrollable tiling presets, gaps, window rules, decoration, and animation controls.
- **Target-driven palette generation**: Theming pipeline supports target-driven Material You palette extraction for more precise color matching.
- **Font verification in doctor**: `setup doctor` now checks for critical fonts (Material Symbols, Roboto Flex, JetBrains Mono NF, Oxanium) and offers automatic installation.
- **Centralized app command execution**: App launcher routes all launch commands through a unified execution path with compositor-aware dispatching.
- **Expanded Niri controls in settings**: Tools surface split with additional Niri-specific compositor controls.
- **Qt/Quickshell ABI mismatch detection**: Three-layer detection (startup check, restart guard, doctor probe) prevents crashes from Qt↔Quickshell version incompatibility.

### Changed
- **Hardened shell transitions**: Improved family transition animation stability and runtime robustness.
- **Hardened doctor/metadata fallback**: Doctor diagnostics and runtime metadata discovery use safer fallback paths and handle missing metadata gracefully.
- **Restart loop prevention**: Launcher detects rapid crash loops and stops respawning after a configurable threshold instead of spinning indefinitely.
- **Repository hygiene**: AI-driven guidance documents and module architecture docs removed from version tracking; gitignore updated for agent artifacts.

### Fixed
- **Close-window double-close race**: `Mod+Q` no longer fires duplicate close commands on Niri.
- **Font token alignment**: Corrected font token references and config schema synchronization across Appearance and settings surfaces.
- **XDG path safety**: Hardened XDG path construction in distribution and setup scripts.
- **Dead code cleanup**: Removed unused code paths and stale references found during comprehensive audit.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Wallpaper pan/zoom**: Reposition and zoom wallpapers within the fill-crop frame with interactive drag-and-scroll settings UI (`background.pan.{x, y, zoom}`).
- **Gowall wallpaper effects**: New `GowallService` and settings editor for wallpaper color manipulation — convert with builtin/custom/Material themes, invert, pixelate, and live preview.
- **Material scheme variant selector**: Choose between Content, Expressive, Fidelity, Monochrome, Neutral, Rainbow, and Tonal Spot color schemes in Control Panel, Waffle Widgets panel, and theme settings pages.
- **InputChip widget**: M3-style compact tag component with optional icon, label, and removable close button.
- **Fields of the Shire theme presets**: New dark and light nature-inspired theme presets with warm earthy tones.
- **Niri keybinds overhaul**: Expanded default keybinds with session dialog, power-off monitors, browser launch, column layout/resize, consume/expel, monitor navigation, media controls, and comprehensive inline documentation.

### Changed
- **Wallpaper selector rewrite**: Skew view rebuilt with rapid-nav velocity tracking, adaptive wheel thresholds (trackpad vs mouse), focus pulse animations, increased cache buffer (600→1400), and adaptive width animation.
- **VSCode theme generators**: Python and Go generators now use HSL color manipulation for richer, more readable syntax highlighting with saturation boosting and contrast-aware token colors.
- **Dock preview**: Live toplevel tracking with stable per-window keys and smart capture-signature deduplication to avoid redundant screenshots.
- **Vertical bar aurora/angel**: Blur layer separated into sibling Item with screen-sized wallpaper image for correct corner alignment; added angel inset glow and partial border.
- **Quick settings redesign**: Hero wallpaper preview with style-aware card, next/random overlay buttons, and improved layout.
- **Waffle system button**: Battery percentage text shown next to icon; network icon filled.
- **Waffle Looks.qml**: Danger/warning colors derived from Material tokens instead of hardcoded values.
- **Color pipeline improvements**: GTK theme application, terminal config generation, material color generation, and Kvantum theming all refined.
- **Launcher restart flow**: `start_background()` uses nohup for proper process detachment; restart via `inir start` instead of direct `qs` exec.

### Fixed
- **Settings direct mutations**: Converted legacy `Config.options` property assignments to `Config.setNestedValue()` in InterfaceConfig (overlay, crosshair, dock settings) and Translator (language persistence).
- **ThumbnailImage path resolution**: Fixed non-absolute path handling and improved URI encoding compliance for thumbnail cache lookup.
- **Scheme variant on manual themes**: Settings pages now use `MaterialThemeLoader.applySchemeVariant()` with seed color for non-auto themes instead of only running `switchwall.sh`.
- **Distribution scripts**: `robust-update.sh`, `snapshots.sh`, and `uninstall.sh` use path-based `qs -p` targeting consistent with the launcher.
- **Super overview daemon**: PID detection matches both legacy `qs -c inir` and path-based `qs -p <path>` process forms.

### Removed
- **OpenCode theme preset**: Removed from ThemePresets (opt-in only via `enableOpenCode` config).

## [2.14.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **`inir` launcher CLI**: Unified daily-use command (`inir run`, `inir restart`, `inir settings`, `inir overview toggle`, etc.) replacing direct `qs` invocation. Supports direct IPC shorthand, maintenance delegation, systemd service management, and version inspection.

- **Arch Linux packaging**: First-class PKGBUILDs for `inir-shell`, `inir-shell-git`, and `inir-meta` under `distro/arch/`.
- **Modular Niri config**: Default Niri configuration split into `config.d/` fragments (input, layout, window-rules, environment, startup, animations, binds, layer-rules, user-extra).
- **Migration 016**: Converts legacy `qs`/`ii`-era Niri keybindings to the `inir` launcher.
- **Migration 017**: Deduplicates hardware keybinds (brightness/media) that accumulated from prior migration bugs.

### Changed
- **Dark mode toggles**: Routed through `MaterialThemeLoader` to ensure a reliable `colors.json` reload after switching.
- **Style selection**: No longer forces `appearance.transparency.enable` when selecting styles.
- **Color system modularized**: `applycolor.sh` rewritten from monolithic script to modular dispatcher with individual modules (terminals, GTK, Qt, Spicetify, SDDM) and shared runtime library.
- **Shell RC namespace**: Setup-managed shell integration files moved from `~/.config/ii/` to `~/.config/inir/`; existing RC includes are migrated in place.
- **Setup behavior for packaged installs**: `setup status`, `setup update`, `setup rollback`, and `setup uninstall` now detect externally-managed installs and provide appropriate guidance instead of assuming repo-based updates.
- **Shell lifecycle commands**: Internal kill/restart/IPC flows use path-based `qs -p <path>` targeting instead of config-name-based `qs -c inir`.
- **Alt-Switcher refactor**: Major refactoring of both ii and waffle alt-switcher components with expanded configuration options.
- **Niri keybinds documentation**: Complete rewrite of `docs/KEYBINDS.md`.

### Fixed
- **Cloudflare WARP toggle**: Periodic status polling to stay in sync.

- **Wallpaper transitions**: New wallpaper changes fast-forward an in-progress transition; background widget placement is debounced.
- **VS Code Material Code theming**: Respects `appearance.wallpaperTheming.enableVSCode`.
- **Waffle user avatar**: More reliable fallback loading.
- **Waffle settings UI**: Improved loading indicator and multiple polish fixes.
- **Weather location privacy**: Toggle now synchronized across all shell surfaces (bar, overview, lock screen, sidebar, control panel) instead of only affecting the Control Panel card.

- **WaffleConfig direct mutation**: Legacy settings writes converted from direct `Config.options` mutation to `Config.setNestedValue()`.
- **Stale `qs -c inir` references**: Setup scripts (robust-update, snapshots, uninstall) and daemon now use path-based targeting consistent with the launcher.
- **Sandbox leak in uninstall**: `Darkly.colors` paths now use `XDG_DATA_HOME` instead of hardcoded `$HOME/.local/share`.

## [2.13.2] - 2026-03-13

- **Zoom controls**: Zoom In, Zoom Out, and Reset Zoom actions for accessibility.
- **On-Screen Keyboard toggle**: Show/hide OSK from action mode.
- **Panel family switching**: Switch between ii and waffle panel families from the palette.
- **Paru package manager support**: All package actions (install, remove, update) detect and use paru as AUR helper alongside yay.
- **Todo feedback**: Adding a todo now shows a desktop notification confirming the task was added, with usage hint when no text provided.

- **Keyboard navigation hints footer**: Shows keybind hints (↑↓ Navigate, ↵ Run, Tab/←→ Category, Esc Close) at the bottom of the action panel for discoverability.

### Changed
- **Wallpaper selector split**: "Change Wallpaper" action now explicitly labeled as Grid or Coverflow, each closing the other before opening.
- **AUR badge theming**: Replaced hardcoded `#1793d1` color with `Appearance.colors.colPrimary` / `Appearance.inir.colPrimary` tokens for proper style-aware rendering.
- **System update action**: Now auto-detects yay/paru/pacman instead of using a hardcoded command.
- **Package install action**: Uses runtime AUR helper detection (`yay > paru > sudo pacman`) instead of hardcoded `yay`.
- **Tab bar spacing**: Added horizontal margins (12px) and increased indicator padding (12px) for proper visual separation between category tabs.

### Fixed
- **iNiR style icon**: Replaced invalid "spark" Material Symbol with "terminal" for the Style: iNiR action.
- **Left/Right arrows in search input**: Removed Left/Right arrow key interception from SearchBar to prevent conflict with text cursor movement. Category cycling from search now uses Tab/Shift+Tab only; Left/Right remain available from the action list delegates where there is no text cursor conflict.
- **Up arrow on first item**: Pressing Up on the first action list item now returns focus to the search input via `returnToSearch` signal.
- **Escape key**: Pressing Escape from within the action list now closes the overview.
- **ReferenceError on action execute**: Refactored `onClicked` to capture action/package references before closing the overview, preventing use-after-destroy crashes.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Backdrop wallpaper transitions**: Both ii and waffle backdrops now use `WallpaperCrossfader` for smooth wallpaper transition animations matching their workspace counterparts.
- **Animated blur toggle**: New `enableAnimatedBlur` config key for GIF/video wallpapers in both families.
- **Blur transition suppression**: Blur fades out before wallpaper transitions so the change is visible even with windows open, then fades back in after transition completes.
- **Waffle backdrop effects controls**: Vignette, saturation, contrast, and animated blur controls added to waffle backdrop settings.
- **Waffle transition config**: Independent transition settings for waffle wallpapers (`waffles.background.transition`).
- **Spicetify wallpaper theming**: Opt-in Material You color scheme for Spotify via Spicetify with live watch mode — colors update on wallpaper change without restarting Spotify (PR #80 by @yukazakiri).
- **Migration 013**: Auto-patch kde-material-you-colors wrapper on update.
- **Migration 014**: Malloc arena optimization (`MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2`, `MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_=131072`) for reduced glibc memory overhead.
- **Migration 015**: Clean orphan config keys (`blurStatic`, `videoBlurStrength` → `thumbnailBlurStrength`) from existing user configs.

### Changed
- **Blur decoupled from awww renderer**: Blur now reads from the crossfader texture regardless of who renders the visible wallpaper, fixing blur not working when parallax is disabled.
- **blurStatic removed**: Blur only activates when windows are present on the workspace. The always-on `blurStatic` option caused rendering issues in both families and has been removed.
- **videoBlurStrength → thumbnailBlurStrength**: Renamed for clarity; migration preserves user values.
- **Saturation/contrast defaults**: Changed from 1.0 to 0 (neutral) for new installs. Existing users keep their values.
- **Backend provider hardcoded**: `awww` backend is now always active (config key ignored, no UI change).
- **Settings surfaces refreshed**: Updated quick options, control panel, and shell surfaces.

### Fixed
- **Wallpaper double-apply**: Prevent duplicate `switchwall.sh` runs with `_applyInProgress` suppression flag and 3-second timer.
- **kde-material-you-colors stacking**: Kill previous daemon instance before launching new one to prevent orphan processes.
- **StyledListView animations**: Use `Transition.enabled` instead of `running` on child animations to prevent animation glitches.
- **Blur alignment**: Reverted `sourceSize÷4` to screen resolution for correct blur positioning.
- **Blur source loading**: Keep wallpaper source always loaded to avoid style-switch freeze.
- **Todo.qml runtime error**: Replaced invalid `Process.exec` with `Quickshell.execDetached`.
- **Config schema sync**: Added `enableOpenCode`, `vscodeEditors` (14 editor forks), and `omp` (oh-my-posh) to schema and defaults — keys existed in theming scripts but were missing from Config.qml.
- **Kitty tab bar colors**: Update live via SIGUSR1 and atomic symlink swap.
- **WaffleConfig stale reference**: Removed UI control for deleted `blurStatic` config key.

### Performance
- **Animation instances**: Replaced 402 `createObject` calls with inline `Animation` instances, eliminating per-animation QObject allocation overhead.
- **Blur GPU gating**: Style-gated `layer.enabled` and `source` on all blur Images — GPU blur work only runs when the active style uses it. Reduced `blurMax` from 100 to 64.
- **Wallpaper caching**: `cache:false` on all wallpaper Images across both families with `sourceSize` constraints to cap decoded pixmap resolution.
- **Thumbnail caching**: Skip `magick` subprocess when thumbnail is already loaded; cache `magick identify` results.
- **Crossfader optimization**: `cache:false` on crossfader slots, release inactive slot texture after transition completes.
- **ColorQuantizer gating**: Only run wallpaper ColorQuantizer when aurora/angel style is active.

- **CryptoWidget**: Cache staleness check — only refresh if older than refreshInterval (default 300s)
- **WaffleConfig**: Use `Config.setNestedValue()` instead of direct property mutation

### Fixed
- **Black peaks on cards**: Gradient and label overlays no longer escape rounded corners (`clip:true` only clips rectangular)
- **Aurora colors for video wallpapers**: ColorQuantizer receives first-frame images instead of undecoded video URLs
- **Backdrop changes all monitors**: Per-monitor backdrop selection now only affects the selected monitor
