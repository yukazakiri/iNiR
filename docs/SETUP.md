# Setup & Updates

## Interactive Menu

```bash
./setup
```

Running `./setup` without arguments launches an interactive menu with all available commands. The menu provides:

- Visual command selection
- Current version, install mode, and update status
- Pending migrations indicator
- Health checks (shell running, Niri detected)
- Snapshot availability

This is the recommended way to use the setup script if you're unsure which command to run.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snowarch/inir.git
cd inir
./setup install
```

Add `-y` for non-interactive mode.

## Update

```bash
./setup update
```

What happens:
1. Checks remote for new commits
2. Creates snapshot (for rollback)
3. Pulls changes
4. Syncs QML code, scripts, assets
5. Syncs Vesktop themes (if present)
6. Applies required migrations automatically
7. Offers optional migrations
8. Restarts shell
9. Checks for missing system packages
10. Updates Python venv packages

Your user configs (`config.json`, `config.kdl`) are never touched.

If `setup` detects that the active iNiR installation is externally managed, `./setup update` does **not** pull or sync repo files into the runtime. In that case it:

- Shows the detected install mode
- Shows the package update command when metadata provides one
- Leaves the shell payload unchanged
- Still applies required migrations if any are pending

## Doctor

```bash
./setup doctor
```

Diagnoses and **automatically fixes** common issues:
- Missing directories
- Script permissions
- Python packages (via uv)
- Version tracking
- File manifest
- Starts shell if not running

For externally managed installs, `doctor` can rebuild `~/.config/illogical-impulse/version.json` from the runtime metadata already present under `~/.config/quickshell/inir/version.json`. It also skips the repo-sync manifest requirement when the install is package-managed.

## Rollback

```bash
./setup rollback
```

Restore a previous snapshot if something breaks after an update. Shows available snapshots with dates and lets you choose which one to restore.

For externally managed installs, `rollback` does not try to restore repo-managed snapshots or reset the checkout. It stops early and points you back to the package manager for shell payload changes.

## Migrate

```bash
./setup migrate
```

Review and apply pending config migrations. Migrations are changes to user configs (keybinds, layer rules, etc.) required by new features.

What happens:
- Shows list of pending migrations
- Displays exactly what each migration will change
- Creates automatic backup before applying
- Lets you choose which migrations to apply
- Required migrations are applied automatically during `update`
- Optional migrations can be applied manually

## My Changes

```bash
./setup my-changes
```

View and manage your modifications to distributed files. The setup script tracks which files you've customized.

What it shows:
- List of files you've modified from defaults
- Option to view differences
- Option to restore original versions
- Option to keep your modifications

Useful when you want to see what you've changed or restore defaults after customization.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `./setup` | Interactive menu |
| `./setup install` | Full installation |
| `./setup update` | Check remote, pull, sync, restart |
| `./setup status` | Show install mode, update strategy, and health |
| `./setup migrate` | Review and apply config migrations |
| `./setup doctor` | Diagnose and auto-fix |
| `./setup rollback` | Restore previous snapshot |
| `./setup my-changes` | View and restore user modifications |
| `./setup uninstall` | Remove iNiR from system |

Options: `-y` (skip prompts), `-q` (quiet), `-h` (help)

## Status

```bash
./setup status
```

Shows:

- Installed version and commit
- Install mode
- Update strategy
- Repo path when relevant
- Health checks and snapshot availability

For externally managed installs, `status` also shows the detected package update command and makes it explicit that repo-sync updates are disabled for that installation mode.

## What Gets Installed

### Core Files

| Source | Destination |
|--------|-------------|
| QML code | `~/.config/quickshell/inir/` |
| User config | `~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json` |
| State files | `~/.local/state/quickshell/user/` |
| Cache | `~/.cache/quickshell/inir/` |
| Super daemon | `~/.local/bin/inir_super_overview_daemon.py` |
| Daemon service | `~/.config/systemd/user/inir-super-overview.service` |

### Compositor & Themes

| Source | Destination |
|--------|-------------|
| Niri config | `~/.config/niri/config.kdl` |
| GTK themes | `~/.config/gtk-3.0/`, `~/.config/gtk-4.0/` |
| Qt themes | `~/.config/kdeglobals`, `~/.config/Kvantum/` |
| Color schemes | `~/.local/share/color-schemes/` |
| Matugen config | `~/.config/matugen/` |
| Fuzzel config | `~/.config/fuzzel/` |
| Vesktop themes | `~/.config/vesktop/themes/` |

### Behavior

- First install: Existing configs are backed up to `~/inir-backup/`
- Updates: Your configs are never touched, only QML code is synced
- Package-managed installs: `./setup update` defers shell payload updates to the package manager instead of syncing from the current repo checkout
- Shared configs: Only installed if they don't exist or you approve overwrite

## Migrations

Some features need config changes (new keybinds, layer rules, etc). After `update`, you're asked if you want to apply pending migrations. Each shows exactly what will change, with automatic backup.

## Backups

- Install backups: `~/inir-backup/`
- Update backups: `~/.local/state/quickshell/backups/`

## Uninstall

### Automated Uninstall (Recommended)

```bash
./setup uninstall
```

The uninstall script intelligently removes iNiR while preserving shared resources and user data:

**What it does:**
- Creates automatic backup before removal
- Removes iNiR-exclusive files and directories
- Asks before removing shared configs (Niri, GTK, themes)
- Detects if you're in a Niri session (preserves compositor config)
- Detects other Quickshell configs (preserves shared resources)
- Detects externally managed shell payloads and warns that package removal is separate
- Lists installed packages with removal recommendations
- Shows commands to revert system changes (groups, modules)

**Interactive mode:**
```bash
./setup uninstall
```

Asks before removing each shared config. Recommended for most users.

**Quick mode:**
```bash
./setup uninstall -y
```

Removes only iNiR-exclusive files, keeps all shared configs and packages.

If the shell payload is externally managed, `uninstall` removes the user-side iNiR config/data it owns but does **not** remove the package-managed payload itself. The command warns about that explicitly.

### Files Removed Automatically

The following are removed without prompting (iNiR-exclusive):

```
~/.config/quickshell/inir/                       # Shell configuration
~/.config/illogical-impulse/                     # User preferences
~/.local/state/quickshell/user/                  # Notifications, todo
~/.cache/quickshell/inir/                        # Cache
~/.local/bin/inir_super_overview_daemon.py       # Super daemon
~/.config/systemd/user/inir-super-overview.service # Daemon service
~/.config/vesktop/themes/system24.theme.css      # Vesktop theme
~/.config/vesktop/themes/ii-colors.css           # Vesktop colors
```

### Shared Configs (Asked Before Removal)

These may be used by other applications. The script asks before removing:

| Path | Type | Default Action |
|------|------|----------------|
| `~/.config/niri/config.kdl` | Essential | Keep (especially if in Niri session) |
| `~/.config/matugen/` | Optional | Ask (remove if matugen not installed) |
| `~/.config/fuzzel/` | Optional | Ask (remove if fuzzel not installed) |
| `~/.config/Kvantum/` | Optional | Ask (remove if Kvantum not installed) |
| `~/.config/kdeglobals` | Optional | Ask |
| `~/.config/dolphinrc` | Optional | Ask (remove if not using Dolphin) |
| `~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css` | Optional | Ask |
| `~/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css` | Optional | Ask |
| `~/.config/fontconfig/` | Essential | Keep |
| `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/color-schemes/Darkly.colors` | iNiR default | Remove |

### Installed Packages

The script lists packages installed by iNiR but does not remove them automatically. Review the output and remove manually if not needed by other applications.

**Core packages:**
- `quickshell` - Shell framework (safe to remove if no other QS configs)
- `niri` - Wayland compositor (keep if using Niri)

**System tools:**
- `cliphist`, `fuzzel`, `swaylock`, `grim`, `slurp`
- `wl-clipboard`, `brightnessctl`, `playerctl`, `dunst`

**Optional tools:**
- `matugen`, `cava`, `easyeffects`

The script provides distro-specific removal commands (pacman, dnf, apt) with safety recommendations.

### System Changes Not Reverted

The following system changes are not automatically reverted. The script shows commands to revert them manually if desired:

- User groups: `video`, `i2c`, `input`
- i2c-dev module: `/etc/modules-load.d/i2c-dev.conf`
- ydotool service

### Backup Location

Backups are saved to:
```
~/.local/share/inir-uninstall-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/
```

To restore from backup:
```bash
cp -r ~/.local/share/inir-uninstall-backup-*/quickshell-inir ~/.config/quickshell/inir
cp -r ~/.local/share/inir-uninstall-backup-*/illogical-impulse ~/.config/illogical-impulse
```

### Manual Uninstall (Fallback)

If the automated script fails or is unavailable:

```bash
# Stop services
qs kill -c inir
systemctl --user disable --now inir-super-overview.service 2>/dev/null

# Remove iNiR-exclusive files
rm -rf ~/.config/quickshell/inir
rm -rf ~/.config/illogical-impulse
