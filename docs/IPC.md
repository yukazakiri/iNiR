# IPC Reference

iNiR exposes IPC targets you can call from Niri keybinds, scripts, or your terminal.

> **Quick discovery:** `inir help` lists all targets, `inir <target> --help` shows available functions.
> Shell completions: `eval "$(inir completions bash)"` (also zsh, fish).

From terminal (for testing, or showing off):

```bash
inir <target> <function>
```

In Niri config (for actual keybinds):

```kdl
bind "Key" { spawn "inir" "<target>" "<function>"; }
```

For low-level debugging, `inir ipc <target> <function>` still works.

---

## Available Targets

Everything iNiR can do, exposed for your scripting pleasure.

### dev

Development navigation for loading lazy surfaces and internal views without
automating pointer or keyboard input. Destination identifiers are stable and
returned as JSON by `list`.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `list` | Return the destination inventory as JSON |
| `open` | Open a destination by semantic identifier |
| `close` | Close development-opened surfaces and clear the request |
| `current` | Return the current destination or `closed` |

```bash
inir dev list | jq -r '.[].id'
inir dev open sidebar-left/anime-schedule
inir dev close
inir dev audit
inir dev audit sidebar-left/ai settings/ai
inir dev audit --all --all-families
```

`inir dev audit` selects destinations related to changed area-specific files in
the current worktree. Destination arguments select an exact scope, while
`--all` requests every safe destination and `--all-families` includes both ii
and waffle. Each visited destination is closed again and new QML warnings or
errors are attributed to the destination that triggered them. Destructive
actions such as locking, recording, power commands, and wallpaper mutation are
excluded.

| `preset` | Set the iRiS appearance preset: `iris`, `soft`, `round`, `crisp`, `angular` or `contrast` |
| `theme <action>` | iRiS themes, each a whole redesign of the family: `list`, `apply:<id>`, `save:<name>` (what you see now becomes a theme file), `import:<path>` (a shared `.json`), `export` or `export:<id>` (prints the theme as JSON to share) and `folder` (where theme files live, `~/.config/inir/iris/themes`) |
| `morph` | Set how iRiS morphs: `direct`, `liquid`, `glide`, `snap`, `elastic` or `instant` |
| `set` | Set any iRiS option by path, e.g. `iris.appearance.theme.pieceShape squircle` or `iris.bubbles.scale 120` (values are JSON when they parse) |
| `adaptive` | How much the wallpaper shapes iRiS, `0`-`100`; any other word prints what was read from the wallpaper |
| `spotlight` | Open Spotlight with a query already typed, e.g. `firefox` or `12*7` (empty for suggestions) |
| `bubbleCard` | Grow a bubble's own card: `weather`, `notifications`, `sound`, `mic`, `tools` or `tray` (from the bubble showing it, else the Island), or `close` |
| `bubbleMenu` | Open a floating bubble's own menu — what it opens, where it rests and how to put it away — by kind (`weather`, `sound`, …) or piece id (`app:kitty`) |
| `utility` | Set the utility satellite: `tray`, `tools`, `sound`, `mic` or `none` |
| `status` | JSON with the Island, Dock, Control Center, Spotlight and side panel state |

### shellLayout

Dedicated persistent-shell layout editing and diagnostics. It is independent
from desktop widget edit mode. It moves the ii bar and dock, swaps semantic ii
sidebars between physical edges, resizes sidebar roles, and moves the Waffle
taskbar through validated operations over canonical Config keys.

| `select` | Select a surface for deterministic editing or diagnostics |
| `lift` | Select and lift a surface for placement |
| `preview` | Preview a legal slot without writing Config |
| `place` | Commit the lifted surface to a validated slot; occupied sidebar edges require the same call twice |
| `cancel` | Cancel the current lift, preview, confirmation or gesture |
| `dragStart` | Lift a surface and start a pointer-style drag |
| `dragUpdate` | Feed screen coordinates to the active drag; previews the nearest legal edge |
| `dragEnd` | Drop the dragged surface: commits the previewed edge (occupied sidebar edges swap directly) or cancels in the center |
| `reset` | Restore one surface to its default placement and supported dimensions |
| `setProperty` | Set a supported surface property (`sizeMode`, sidebar `height`, sidebar `thickness`, or dock `thickness`) |
| `handleEscape` | Apply editor Escape priority: cancel pending work, then leave edit mode |
| `status` | Return edit-session, host diagnostics and active-family surface descriptors as JSON |
| `validate` | Validate a surface and slot combination without changing Config |

```bash
inir shellLayout open
inir shellLayout lift featureSidebar
inir shellLayout preview right
inir shellLayout place right   # prepares the occupied-edge swap
inir shellLayout place right   # confirms and commits it
inir shellLayout setProperty featureSidebar sizeMode fit
inir shellLayout reset featureSidebar
inir shellLayout close

`~/.config/niri/config.d/50-startup.kdl` (delimited by `// >>> inir-managed-autostart >>>` /
`// <<< inir-managed-autostart <<<`). Base iNiR lines and any hand-written
`spawn-at-startup` lines outside the markers are preserved verbatim; toggling an
entry comments the line out instead of deleting it. Safe no-op on non-Niri
compositors (the page shows a guard instead).

The Settings UI (ii: AutostartConfig, waffle: WAutostartPage) is the primary
interface; these IPC calls exist for scripts/keybinds. Apps the user already
launches via hand-written lines outside the markers are detected and shown as
"External" (read-only) in the list.

---
