# Race condition protection:
# 1. We capture the focused window ID immediately (before spawn latency can shift focus).
# 2. QS has a 2-second startup grace period where it ignores closeConfirm triggers.
# 3. If IPC fails/times out, we close the *captured* window by ID — not whatever is
#    focused at fallback time.
# 4. Because both paths target the same window by ID, an accidental double-close is a
#    harmless no-op instead of killing a random window.
