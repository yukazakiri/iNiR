# Wallpaper System

Pick a wallpaper and the entire desktop follows. Colors propagate to the shell, GTK apps, terminals, Firefox, Discord, VS Code, and the SDDM login screen.

## Setting a wallpaper

**From the shell**: open the wallpaper selector (`Super+W` or through Settings) and browse your filesystem. Click a wallpaper to apply it. The color pipeline runs automatically.

**From the CLI**:

```bash
inir wallpapers set /path/to/image.jpg
```

**From Settings**: Appearance section lets you configure wallpaper behavior, blur, and auto-cycling.

## What happens when you set a wallpaper

```
Image selected
  |
switchwall.sh (orchestrator)
  |
generate_colors_material.py
  - Extracts dominant colors from the image
  - Generates a full Material 3 palette (50+ color tokens)
  - Writes colors.json
  |
applycolor.sh (runs per-app theming modules in parallel)
  - GTK 3/4 themes
  - Terminal configs (foot, kitty, alacritty)
  - Starship prompt
  - Fuzzel launcher
  - Firefox (pywalfox)
  - VS Code, Cursor, OpenCode (Go generators)
  - btop, lazygit, yazi
  - SDDM login theme
  - Discord/Vesktop
  |
MaterialThemeLoader (QML, watches colors.json)
  |
Appearance tokens update --> Every UI component re-renders
```

The whole pipeline takes 2-3 seconds. The shell updates immediately when colors.json changes. External apps update within a few seconds as their configs are rewritten.

## Supported formats

**Images**: jpg, jpeg, png, webp, avif, gif, bmp, tiff, jxl

**Video**: mp4, webm, mkv, avi, mov. The first frame is extracted for color generation. Video plays as a live wallpaper with optional blur.

## Multi-monitor

Each monitor can have its own wallpaper. Configure per-monitor wallpapers in Settings under Appearance > Background > Multi-monitor.

Per-monitor config includes:
- Wallpaper path
- Optional workspace range (for Niri's scrolling workspaces)
- Optional backdrop path (for glass blur effects in Aurora/Angel styles)

## Video wallpapers

Video files play as live wallpapers. First frame is automatically extracted and cached at `~/.cache/quickshell/video_thumbnails/` for color generation and thumbnail display.

Options:
- **Blur**: apply blur to the video
- **Freeze frame**: show only the first frame (saves GPU)
- **Loop**: video loops continuously

## Backdrop system

The Aurora and Angel styles use frosted glass effects. The "backdrop" is a separate wallpaper (or the main wallpaper with heavy blur) that renders behind glass surfaces. This lets you have a sharp wallpaper on the desktop and a blurred version showing through transparent panels.

## Auto-cycling

Set an interval and iNiR cycles through wallpapers in a directory automatically. Configurable per-directory with optional color regeneration on each change.

## Wallhaven integration

The left sidebar includes a Wallhaven browser. Search wallhaven.cc, preview results, and apply wallpapers directly from the shell. Supports NSFW filtering, resolution filtering, and category selection.

## Theme presets

44 built-in presets bypass the wallpaper color pipeline entirely and inject predefined color palettes. See [Theming Presets](THEMING_PRESETS.md).

When a preset is active, changing wallpapers still changes the background image but doesn't regenerate colors. Switch back to "Auto" mode in Settings to restore wallpaper-based theming.

## CLI reference

```bash
inir wallpapers set <path>          # Set wallpaper and regenerate colors
inir wallpapers get                 # Get current wallpaper path
inir wallpapers random <directory>  # Set a random wallpaper from directory
```
