# ii on Niri

A Quickshell shell for Niri. Fork of end-4's illogical-impulse, butchered to work on a different compositor.

> **Heads up:** almost everything here is configurable. Modules, colors, fonts, animations - if something bugs you, there's probably a toggle for it. Hit `Super+,` for settings before you rage-quit.

## What is this

A shell. Bar at the top, sidebars on the sides, overlays that pop up when you press keys. The usual.

- **Bar** - clock, workspaces, tray, the stuff you expect
- **Sidebars** - left one has AI chat and wallpaper browser, right one has quick toggles and a notepad
- **Overview** - workspace grid, adapted for Niri's scrolling model
- **Alt+Tab** - window switcher that actually works across workspaces
- **Clipboard** - history panel with search (needs cliphist)
- **Region tools** - screenshots, screen recording, OCR, reverse image search
- **Wallpaper** - picker, video support, and matugen pulls colors from whatever you set
- **Theming** - presets like Gruvbox and Catppuccin, or build your own with the custom theme editor. Fonts are customizable too
- **Settings** - GUI config with search, so you don't have to edit JSON like a caveman
- **GameMode** - fullscreen app? Effects go bye-bye. Your games won't stutter
- **Idle** - screen off, lock, suspend timeouts. swayidle handles it, you configure it

## IPC (for nerds who want custom bindings)

ii exposes IPC targets you can bind to whatever keys you want. Syntax:

```kdl
bind "Key" { spawn "qs" "-c" "ii" "ipc" "call" "<target>" "<function>"; }
```

Main targets:

| Target | Functions |
|--------|-----------|
| `overview` | `toggle` |
| `overlay` | `toggle` |
| `clipboard` | `toggle`, `open`, `close` |
| `altSwitcher` | `next`, `previous`, `toggle` |
| `region` | `screenshot`, `ocr`, `search`, `record` |
| `session` | `toggle` |
| `lock` | `activate` |
| `cheatsheet` | `toggle` |
| `settings` | `open` |
| `sidebarLeft` | `toggle` |
| `sidebarRight` | `toggle` |
| `wallpaperSelector` | `toggle` |
| `mpris` | `playPause`, `next`, `previous` |
| `brightness` | `increment`, `decrement` |
| `gamemode` | `toggle`, `activate`, `deactivate`, `status` |

## Troubleshooting

Something broke? Shocking.

```bash
# Check the logs
qs log -c ii

# Restart ii without restarting Niri
qs kill -c ii && qs -c ii

# Nuclear option: reload everything
niri msg action load-config-file
```

If you're still stuck, the logs usually tell you what's missing. Usually.

## Fair warning

This is my daily driver. It works. Most of the time. I break things when I'm bored.

If you want something stable and polished, check out end-4's original ii for Hyprland instead. This fork is for people who like living dangerously on Niri.
