# ii on Niri

A Quickshell shell for Niri. Fork of end-4's illogical-impulse, butchered to work on a different compositor.

## What is this

A shell. Bar at the top, sidebars on the sides, overlays that pop up when you press keys. The usual.

- **Bar** - clock, workspaces, tray, the stuff you expect
- **Sidebars** - left one has AI chat and apps, right one has toggles and a notepad
- **Overview** - workspace grid, adapted for Niri's scrolling model
- **Alt+Tab** - window switcher that actually works across workspaces
- **Clipboard** - history panel with search (needs cliphist)
- **Region tools** - screenshots, screen recording, OCR, reverse image search
- **Wallpaper stuff** - picker, matugen colors, video wallpaper support
- **Settings** - GUI config with search, so you don't have to edit JSON like a caveman

## Keybinds (the important ones)

These come configured by default:

## IPC (for custom bindings)

ii exposes IPC targets you can bind to keys. The syntax:

```kdl
bind "Key" { spawn "qs" "-c" "ii" "ipc" "call" "<target>" "<function>"; }
```

Main targets:

| Target | Functions |
|--------|-----------|
| `overview` | `toggle` |
| `overlay` | `toggle` |
| `clipboard` | `toggle`, `open`, `close` |
| `altSwitcher` | `next`, `previous`, `toggle` |
| `region` | `screenshot`, `ocr`, `search`, `record` |
| `session` | `toggle` |
| `lock` | `activate` |
| `cheatsheet` | `toggle` |
| `sidebarLeft` | `toggle` |
| `sidebarRight` | `toggle` |
| `wallpaperSelector` | `toggle` |
| `mpris` | `playPause`, `next`, `previous` |
| `brightness` | `increment`, `decrement` |

## Fair warning

This is my daily driver. It works. Most of the time. I break things when I'm bored.

If something explodes, check the logs:

```bash
qs log -c ii
```

If you want something stable and polished, check out end-4's original ii for Hyprland instead.
